Centralized Statistics Aggregator

Serves as the bridge between individual play results and comprehensive game statistics.
Coordinates the flow of statistics from PlayResult objects to PlayerStatsAccumulator and
TeamStatsAccumulator, while maintaining game-level statistics.

This class solves the integration gap between the GameLoopController (which generates
PlayResult objects) and the existing proven statistics infrastructure.
