Game Loop Controller

Orchestrates complete NFL game simulation by coordinating all existing components:
- GameManager for clock, possession, and scoring
- CoachingStaff for realistic play calling
- DriveManager for individual drives
- PlayEngine for play execution
- Statistics tracking throughout

Designed for unit testing with clear separation of concerns.
