    Centralized configuration for coaching archetype balance - easy for game designers to tune
    
    This class contains all the magic numbers that affect play calling intelligence.
    Adjust these values to change coaching behavior:
    - Higher risk_tolerance = more aggressive 4th down decisions
    - Stronger situation_modifiers = more realistic coaching responses
    - Defensive influence factors affect counter-play calling
