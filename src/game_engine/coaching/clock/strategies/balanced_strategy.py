Balanced Clock Strategy

Neutral timing coaching archetype that emphasizes:
- Default NFL tempo without extreme variations
- Minimal archetype-specific modifiers
- Situational awareness without aggressive adjustments
- Serves as baseline for comparison with other archetypes

    Neutral coaching archetype that represents standard NFL tempo and clock management.
    
    Characteristics:
    - Minimal base adjustments (Â±0-1 seconds)
    - Relies primarily on situational modifiers
    - Default behavior for most coaching decisions
    - Serves as baseline comparison for other archetypes
