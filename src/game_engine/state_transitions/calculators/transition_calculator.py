Main Transition Calculator - Pure State Calculation Coordinator

This module coordinates all state transition calculations based on PlayResult and GameState.
It contains only pure functions with no side effects, calculating what should happen
without actually changing any state.

All functions take PlayResult and GameState as inputs and return appropriate 
transition objects from the data_structures module.
