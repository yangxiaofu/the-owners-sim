ScoreTransition - Score and Touchdown Logic

This data structure represents all scoring plays and score changes in the game.
It handles touchdowns, field goals, safeties, extra points, two-point conversions,
and all related scoring scenarios.

Key responsibilities:
- Track all types of scoring plays
- Manage point values and score updates
- Handle extra point and conversion attempts
- Track scoring player and team information
- Determine if kickoff is required after scoring
