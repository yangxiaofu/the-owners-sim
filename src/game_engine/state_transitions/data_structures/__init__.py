"""
Immutable Data Structures for Game State Transitions

This module contains all the immutable data structures that represent different
types of state changes in the football game simulation. Each transition object
is frozen (immutable) and contains all the data needed for that specific type
of state change.

All transition objects follow these principles:
- Immutable using @dataclass(frozen=True)
- Comprehensive type hints for all fields
- Complete docstrings explaining each field
- Contains all data needed for the specific transition type
- Can be easily tested and verified
