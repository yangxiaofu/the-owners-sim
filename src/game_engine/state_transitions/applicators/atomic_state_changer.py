Atomic State Changer - Low-Level Atomic Operations

This module provides low-level atomic operations with rollback support.
It captures the state before changes and can restore it if any operation fails,
ensuring transaction-like behavior for game state modifications.

Key Features:
- Captures complete state snapshots before changes
- Atomic operations with rollback capability
- Deep copying of complex state objects
- Transaction boundaries with begin/commit/rollback
