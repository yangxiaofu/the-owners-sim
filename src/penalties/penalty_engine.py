Penalty Engine - Core Logic for NFL Penalty Simulation

The PenaltyEngine is responsible for:
1. Determining when penalties occur based on player discipline and game situation
2. Selecting which player commits the penalty
3. Applying penalty effects to play results
4. Creating comprehensive penalty tracking data

Integrates with the two-stage run play simulation system.
