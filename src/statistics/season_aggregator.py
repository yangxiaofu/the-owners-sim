"""
Season Aggregator for Statistics Preservation System

Aggregates game-level statistics into season summaries for archival.
This is distinct from SeasonStatsAggregator which handles real-time updates.

Key Differences:
- Returns structured dataclasses (PlayerSeasonStats, SeasonArchive)
- Designed for end-of-season batch processing
- Includes award tracking and season metadata
- Pure data transformation (no database writes)
