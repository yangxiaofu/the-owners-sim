Playoff Controller

Core orchestration logic for playoff simulation.
Coordinates calendar advancement, playoff bracket generation, and game execution.

This controller is the central component for playoff simulation, managing the interaction between:
- CalendarComponent (date/time management)
- EventDatabaseAPI (event storage/retrieval)
- SimulationExecutor (game execution orchestration)
- PlayoffSeeder (playoff seeding calculation)
- PlayoffManager (bracket generation)
- PlayoffScheduler (GameEvent creation)
