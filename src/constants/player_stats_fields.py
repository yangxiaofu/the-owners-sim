"""
Player Statistics Field Names

Centralized enum system for standardizing player statistics field names across
the entire codebase. Eliminates naming convention inconsistencies between
simulation, persistence, and display layers.

This enum uses the simulation layer naming convention as the canonical standard.
All layers (simulation, persistence, database, display) should use these names.
