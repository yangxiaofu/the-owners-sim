Player Roster Database API

Manages player rosters in database. JSON files used ONLY for initialization.

Architecture:
- JSON files preserved permanently (never deleted)
- JSON accessed ONLY during dynasty creation (one-time migration)
- Database is SOLE source during gameplay (no fallbacks)
- Dynasty isolation via dynasty_id foreign keys
