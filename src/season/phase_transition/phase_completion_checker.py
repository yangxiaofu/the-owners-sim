Phase Completion Checker

Checks if NFL season phases are complete using injectable dependencies.

This module provides a testable phase completion checker that uses protocol-based
dependency injection instead of direct database access. This enables pure logic
testing without I/O operations.

Design Principles:
- Dependency injection via callable protocols
- Pure logic with no side effects
- Clear separation of concerns (logic vs data access)
- Testable without database

Example Usage:
    # Production usage with real database access
    checker = PhaseCompletionChecker(
        get_games_played=lambda: game_db_api.get_games_played_count(dynasty_id),
        get_current_date=lambda: calendar_manager.get_current_date(),
        get_last_regular_season_game_date=lambda: Date(2025, 1, 5),
        is_super_bowl_complete=lambda: playoff_controller.is_super_bowl_complete()
    )

    if checker.is_regular_season_complete():
        transition_to_playoffs()

    # Testing with mocks
    checker = PhaseCompletionChecker(
        get_games_played=lambda: 272,
        get_current_date=lambda: Date(2025, 1, 10),
        get_last_regular_season_game_date=lambda: Date(2025, 1, 5),
        is_super_bowl_complete=lambda: False
    )

    assert checker.is_regular_season_complete() is True

    Checks phase completion status with testable, injectable logic.

    This class determines whether NFL season phases (regular season, playoffs)
    are complete by using injected dependency functions. This design enables
    unit testing without database access or I/O operations.

    The checker uses two complementary approaches for regular season completion:
    1. Game count (primary): 272 games = 32 teams × 17 games / 2
    2. Date check (fallback): Current date past last scheduled game

    For playoffs, completion is determined by Super Bowl completion status.

    Attributes:
        _get_games_played: Callable that returns count of completed games
        _get_current_date: Callable that returns current simulation date
        _get_last_regular_season_game_date: Callable that returns final game date
        _is_super_bowl_complete: Callable that checks Super Bowl completion
        _calculate_preseason_start: Callable that calculates preseason start date

    Thread Safety:
        This class is thread-safe as it contains no mutable state. All state
        is retrieved via injected callables at the time of method invocation.

        This constructor accepts callable functions instead of concrete objects,
        enabling flexible dependency injection for both production and testing.

        Args:
            get_games_played: Function that returns count of games played in
                current season. Should return 0-272 for regular season.
                Example: lambda: database_api.count_completed_games(dynasty_id)

            get_current_date: Function that returns current simulation date.
                Should return Date object representing "today" in simulation.
                Example: lambda: calendar_manager.get_current_date()

            get_last_regular_season_game_date: Function that returns the date
                of the final scheduled regular season game (typically early Jan).
                Example: lambda: Date(2025, 1, 5)

            is_super_bowl_complete: Function that checks if Super Bowl has been
                played and completed. Should return boolean.
                Example: lambda: playoff_controller.is_super_bowl_complete()

            calculate_preseason_start: Function that calculates the preseason
                start date for the upcoming season (typically early August).
                Example: lambda: schedule_generator.calculate_preseason_start_date()

        Raises:
            None. Validation occurs at method call time, not initialization.

        Design Notes:
            Using lambdas or bound methods allows lazy evaluation - dependencies
            are queried only when needed, not at construction time. This supports
            dynamic state changes and reduces coupling.

        Check if regular season is complete using pure logic.

        This method determines regular season completion using two complementary
        criteria (both are checked, either can trigger completion):

        1. Primary Check - Game Count:
           - NFL regular season = 32 teams × 17 games / 2 = 272 total games
           - If games_played >= 272, season is definitely complete
           - Most reliable indicator as it's based on concrete game results

        2. Fallback Check - Date Progression:
           - If current date > last scheduled game date, season should be complete
           - Handles edge cases where game counting might be unreliable
           - Ensures calendar progression triggers transition even if game count off

        The dual-criteria approach provides robustness against data inconsistencies
        while maintaining clear, testable logic.

        Returns:
            bool: True if regular season is complete (272+ games OR date past
                last game), False otherwise.

        Example:
            >>> checker.is_regular_season_complete()
            True  # If 272 games played

            >>> checker.is_regular_season_complete()

        Check if playoffs are complete using pure logic.

        This method determines playoff completion by checking if the Super Bowl
        has been played. The Super Bowl is the final game of the NFL season,
        so its completion definitively marks the end of the playoff phase.

        Playoff Structure (for context):
        - Wild Card Round: 6 games (weekend 1)
        - Divisional Round: 4 games (weekend 2)
        - Conference Championships: 2 games (weekend 3)
        - Super Bowl: 1 game (weekend 4)
        - Total: 13 playoff games

        However, we only check Super Bowl completion as it's the definitive
        marker of playoff phase completion. Intermediate round completion
        is not relevant for phase transition logic.

        Returns:
            bool: True if Super Bowl has been played and completed, False otherwise.

        Example:
            >>> checker.is_playoffs_complete()
            True  # If Super Bowl completed

            >>> checker.is_playoffs_complete()

        Design Notes:
            We delegate to an injected callable rather than checking game counts
            or dates because playoff completion logic may vary based on:
            - Playoff controller implementation details
            - Database schema for playoff games
            - Business rules for "completion" (game finished vs awards given, etc.)

            By injecting this dependency, we maintain flexibility and testability.

        Check if offseason is complete and ready for preseason using pure logic.

        This method determines offseason completion by checking if the current
        simulation date has reached or passed the preseason start date (typically
        early August). When this condition is met, the system should transition
        from OFFSEASON to PRESEASON phase and initialize the new season.

        Offseason typically includes:
        - Free agency period (March-April)
        - NFL Draft (late April)
        - Rookie mini-camp and OTAs (May-June)
        - Training camp preparation (July)
        - Preseason begins (early August)

        Returns:
            bool: True if current date >= preseason start date, False otherwise.

        Design Notes:
            Unlike regular season (which checks game count + date) and playoffs
            (which checks Super Bowl completion), offseason completion is purely
            date-based. The offseason has no "games" to count, so calendar
            progression is the natural completion trigger.

            The preseason start date is typically calculated as the first Thursday
            in August, which aligns with the traditional NFL preseason schedule.
