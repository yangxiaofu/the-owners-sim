Season Cycle Controller

Unified controller orchestrating the complete NFL season cycle from
Week 1 Regular Season → Super Bowl → Offseason.

This controller manages the three distinct phases:
1. REGULAR_SEASON: 272 games across 18 weeks
2. PLAYOFFS: 13 games (Wild Card → Super Bowl)
3. OFFSEASON: Post-season state with summary (future: draft, free agency, training camp)

Responsibilities:
- Coordinate SeasonController (regular season) and PlayoffController (playoffs)
- Handle automatic phase transitions
- Maintain calendar continuity across phases
- Preserve dynasty isolation
- Provide unified API for day/week advancement
- Support complete annual simulation cycle

This is a production-ready controller that should be used for full season simulations.
For individual phase control, use SeasonController or PlayoffController directly.
