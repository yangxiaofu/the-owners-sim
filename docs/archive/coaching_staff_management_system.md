# Coaching Staff Management System - Option A Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement a dynamic Coaching Staff Management System using Option A architecture - following the established codebase pattern of comprehensive single-file systems like `play_calling.py`.

## Architecture Design - Option A

### Directory Structure
```
src/game_engine/coaching/
├── __init__.py                    # Package exports
├── coaching_staff.py              # Main comprehensive system (~600 lines)  
└── coaching_constants.py          # Data structures and constants (~150 lines)
```

### Core Philosophy
- **Single Comprehensive File**: All coaching logic in `coaching_staff.py` (like `play_calling.py`)
- **Clean Data Separation**: Constants and configurations in `coaching_constants.py`
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Simple imports matching existing patterns
- **Future-Friendly**: Easy location for coaching carousel and advanced features

## File Specifications

### New Files

#### `src/game_engine/coaching/__init__.py` (~10 lines)
```python
from .coaching_staff import CoachingStaff
from .coaching_constants import COACH_PERSONALITIES, ADAPTATION_THRESHOLDS

__all__ = ['CoachingStaff', 'COACH_PERSONALITIES', 'ADAPTATION_THRESHOLDS']
```

#### `src/game_engine/coaching/coaching_staff.py` (~600 lines)
**Structure follows `play_calling.py` pattern:**

```python
# Configuration class (like PlayCallingBalance)
class CoachingBalance:
    """Centralized coaching configuration for easy tuning"""
    ADAPTATION_THRESHOLDS = {...}
    EXPERIENCE_MULTIPLIERS = {...}
    
# Main coaching classes
class OffensiveCoordinator:
    """Individual offensive coordinator with personality and adaptation"""
    def __init__(self, base_archetype, experience, adaptability):
    def prepare_for_game(self, opponent_data, game_context):
    def get_current_archetype(self, game_situation):
    def adapt_to_game_flow(self, current_effectiveness, game_state):

class DefensiveCoordinator:
    """Individual defensive coordinator with personality and adaptation"""
    # Similar structure to OffensiveCoordinator

class CoachingStaff:
    """Main class managing both coordinators - like PlayCaller"""
    def __init__(self, team_id, coaching_config=None):
    def prepare_for_game(self, opponent_team, game_context):
    def get_offensive_coordinator_for_situation(self, game_state):
    def get_defensive_coordinator_for_situation(self, game_state):
    def adapt_during_game(self, game_flow_data):
```

**Key Features:**
- **Persistent Personalities**: Coordinators maintain base traits across games
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adjust archetypes based on opponent and context  
- **Game Planning**: Pre-game analysis and strategy selection
- **In-Game Intelligence**: Score, time, and momentum-based adjustments
- **Historical Memory**: Remember successful strategies vs specific opponents
- **Experience Factor**: More experienced coaches make better adaptations

#### `src/game_engine/coaching/coaching_constants.py` (~150 lines)
**Data-only file like existing constants patterns:**

```python
# Coach personality templates
COACH_PERSONALITIES = {
    "innovative": {
        "base_archetype": "air_raid",
        "adaptability": 0.85,
        "risk_tolerance": 0.75,
        "opponent_memory_weight": 0.70
    },
    "traditional": {
        "base_archetype": "conservative", 
        "adaptability": 0.45,
        "risk_tolerance": 0.25,
        "opponent_memory_weight": 0.40
    },
    # ... more personality templates
}

# Adaptation thresholds and modifiers
ADAPTATION_THRESHOLDS = {
    "score_differential_major": 14,
    "effectiveness_poor": 0.30,
    "momentum_shift_trigger": 0.25,
}

# Historical matchup bonuses  
OPPONENT_MEMORY_BONUSES = {...}

# Experience level effects
EXPERIENCE_MULTIPLIERS = {...}
```

### Modified Files

#### `src/game_engine/core/game_orchestrator.py` (~50 line modification)
**Replace hardcoded coaching data with CoachingStaff initialization:**

```python
# Current (lines 47-58):
"coaching": {
    "offensive": 60, 
    "defensive": 75,
    "offensive_coordinator": {
        "archetype": "run_heavy",
        "custom_modifiers": {"power_emphasis": +0.08}
    },
    "defensive_coordinator": {
        "archetype": "run_stuffing", 
        "custom_modifiers": {"interior_strength": +0.10}
    }
}

# New approach:
"coaching_staff": CoachingStaff(
    team_id=1,
    coaching_config={
        "offensive_coordinator_personality": "traditional",
        "defensive_coordinator_personality": "aggressive",
        "team_philosophy": "run_heavy_defense"
    }
)
```

**Implementation:**
- Add `from ..coaching import CoachingStaff` import
- Replace coaching dict with CoachingStaff initialization for all 8 teams
- Maintain backward compatibility by keeping coaching ratings
- Add realistic coach personalities based on NFL team identities

#### `src/game_engine/core/play_executor.py` (~20 line modification)
**Update archetype extraction to use dynamic coaching staff:**

```python
# Current (lines 42-43):
offensive_coordinator = offense_team.get('coaching', {}).get('offensive_coordinator', {'archetype': 'balanced'})
defensive_coordinator = defense_team.get('coaching', {}).get('defensive_coordinator', {'archetype': 'balanced_defense'})

# New approach:
coaching_staff = offense_team.get('coaching_staff')
if coaching_staff:
    game_context = {
        'opponent': defense_team,
        'score_differential': game_state.get_score_differential(),
        'time_remaining': game_state.clock.get_time_remaining(),
        'field_position': game_state.field.field_position
    }
    offensive_coordinator = coaching_staff.get_offensive_coordinator_for_situation(game_context)
    defensive_coaching_staff = defense_team.get('coaching_staff') 
    defensive_coordinator = defensive_coaching_staff.get_defensive_coordinator_for_situation(game_context) if defensive_coaching_staff else {'archetype': 'balanced_defense'}
else:
    # Fallback to current system for backward compatibility
    offensive_coordinator = offense_team.get('coaching', {}).get('offensive_coordinator', {'archetype': 'balanced'})
    defensive_coordinator = defense_team.get('coaching', {}).get('defensive_coordinator', {'archetype': 'balanced_defense'})
```

### Test Files

#### `test_coaching_staff.py` (~500 lines)
**Comprehensive unit testing following existing test patterns:**

```python
class TestCoachingStaff(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_coordinator_initialization(self):
    def test_game_preparation_changes_strategy(self):
    def test_in_game_adaptation_triggers(self):
    def test_opponent_specific_memories(self):
    def test_experience_affects_decision_quality(self):
    def test_nfl_realism_benchmarks_maintained(self):
    def test_backward_compatibility(self):
```

**Focus Areas:**
- Coordinator personality consistency across games
- Adaptive behavior triggers and thresholds
- NFL statistical benchmark maintenance
- Integration with existing PlayCaller system
- Performance regression prevention

#### `test_coaching_integration.py` (~200 lines)
**Full integration testing:**
- Complete game simulations with coaching staff active
- Multi-game coaching memory and learning verification
- Performance benchmarking vs current system

## Implementation Strategy

### Key Design Principles

1. **Follow Existing Patterns**: Mirror `play_calling.py` structure exactly
   - Configuration class at top (CoachingBalance vs PlayCallingBalance)
   - Main logic classes in middle (CoachingStaff vs PlayCaller)  
   - Helper methods at bottom following same naming conventions

2. **Minimal Integration Points**: 
   - Single import: `from ..coaching import CoachingStaff`
   - Single interface: `coaching_staff.get_offensive_coordinator_for_situation()`
   - Backward compatibility maintained for existing systems

3. **Data-Driven Configuration**:
   - All tuning parameters in CoachingBalance class
   - Easy modification without touching core logic
   - Same pattern as PlayCallingBalance for consistency

4. **NFL Realism Maintenance**:
   - Preserve all existing archetype behavior ranges
   - Add adaptation without breaking statistical distributions
   - Comprehensive benchmark validation in tests

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (~2 hours)
