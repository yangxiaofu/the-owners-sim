# Personnel-Fatigue Integration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive architectural redesign to integrate personnel selection and fatigue management directly into play simulation, transforming them from cosmetic features into functionally impactful game mechanics.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### The Problem

The current play execution flow has two critical architectural gaps:

```python
# Current PlayExecutor.execute_play() flow:
personnel = self.player_selector.get_personnel(...)  # Step 2: Detailed selection
play_result = play_instance.simulate(offense_team, defense_team, field_state)  # Step 4: IGNORES personnel!
self._add_context_to_result(play_result, personnel, game_state)  # Step 5: Adds metadata
self.player_selector.apply_fatigue(personnel.offensive_players, play_result.__dict__)  # Step 6: Too late!
```

**Gap 1: Personnel Selection Ignored**
- Detailed personnel selection creates `PersonnelPackage` with individual players, formations, and matchups
- Play simulation uses generic team ratings instead of selected personnel
- Individual player abilities, formations, and tactical decisions have zero impact on outcomes

**Gap 2: Fatigue Timing Issue**
- Fatigue is applied *after* play simulation as post-processing
- Players perform at full effectiveness regardless of current fatigue state
- Different play types don't cause appropriate fatigue patterns
- Fatigue becomes a cosmetic stat rather than a performance factor

### Current PlayType Interface

```python
class PlayType(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def simulate(self, offense_team: Dict, defense_team: Dict, field_state: FieldState) -> PlayResult:
        """Simulate using generic team ratings - no personnel awareness"""
        pass
```

### Code Clarity Issues

- Method `_add_context_to_result()` has unclear naming - doesn't indicate it adds analytical metadata
- Method compensates for personnel not being used in simulation
- Mixing of simulation logic and metadata enrichment

## Proposed Architecture Changes

### 1. Personnel-Aware Play Simulation

**New PlayType Interface:**
```python
class PlayType(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def simulate(self, personnel: PersonnelPackage, field_state: FieldState) -> PlayResult:
        """Simulate using actual selected personnel with current conditions"""
        pass
```

**Key Changes:**
- Accept `PersonnelPackage` instead of raw team data
- Use individual player effective ratings (base × fatigue × injury multipliers)
- Apply formation-specific advantages/disadvantages
- Factor in player-vs-player matchups

### 2. Fatigue Integration During Simulation

**Pre-Simulation Fatigue Impact:**
```python
# Player effective ratings calculated from current state
effective_rb_rating = rb.get_effective_attribute('power')  # Accounts for fatigue
effective_ol_rating = sum(ol.effective_rating for ol in personnel.ol_on_field) / len(personnel.ol_on_field)
```

**During-Simulation Usage:**
- All performance calculations use effective ratings instead of base ratings
- Tired players perform worse in blocking, running, coverage, etc.
- Formation advantages scaled by player effectiveness

**Post-Simulation Fatigue Application:**
```python
# Different fatigue patterns based on play type and individual effort
def apply_play_fatigue(self, personnel: PersonnelPackage, play_result: PlayResult):
    if play_result.play_type == "run":
        # Power runs fatigue RB and interior OL more
        # Sweep plays fatigue pulling guards and RB differently
    elif play_result.play_type == "pass":
        # Pass rushers high fatigue on sacks
        # QB/WR moderate fatigue on completions
```

### 3. Formation Impact Modeling

**Formation Advantages:**
```python
def get_formation_modifier(offense_formation: str, defense_call: str, play_type: str) -> float:
    """Calculate formation advantage/disadvantage modifier"""
    advantages = {
        ("goal_line", "base_defense", "run"): 1.15,  # Power formation vs base
        ("shotgun_spread", "base_run_defense", "pass"): 1.20,  # Spread vs run defense
        ("i_formation", "nickel_pass", "run"): 1.10,  # Power vs pass defense
        # ... more matchups
    }
    return advantages.get((offense_formation, defense_call, play_type), 1.0)
```

### 4. Enhanced Play Implementation Examples

**RunPlay with Personnel Integration:**
```python
class RunPlay(PlayType):
    def simulate(self, personnel: PersonnelPackage, field_state: FieldState) -> PlayResult:
        # Use actual selected personnel
        rb = personnel.get_running_back()
        ol_players = personnel.get_offensive_line()
        dl_players = personnel.get_defensive_line()
        
        # Calculate effective ratings with fatigue
        rb_power = rb.get_effective_attribute('power') if rb else 50
        ol_blocking = sum(ol.get_effective_attribute('run_blocking') for ol in ol_players) / len(ol_players)
        dl_stopping = sum(dl.get_effective_attribute('run_defense') for dl in dl_players) / len(dl_players)
        
        # Apply formation modifier
        formation_bonus = self.get_formation_modifier(
            personnel.formation, personnel.defensive_call, "run"
        )
        
        # Enhanced simulation with real player data
        success_rate = (rb_power + ol_blocking) / (rb_power + ol_blocking + dl_stopping * 1.2)
        success_rate *= formation_bonus
        
        # Rest of simulation logic...
```

**PassPlay with Personnel Integration:**
```python
class PassPlay(PlayType):
    def simulate(self, personnel: PersonnelPackage, field_state: FieldState) -> PlayResult:
        # Extract from personnel instead of team ratings
        qb_rating = personnel.offensive_players.get('qb', 50)  # Fallback for team mode
        wr_rating = personnel.offensive_players.get('wr', 50)
        db_rating = personnel.defensive_players.get('db', 50)
        
        # If individual players available, use their effective ratings
        if personnel.individual_players:
            # Use specific QB/WR/DB players when available
            pass
        
        # Apply formation advantages
        formation_bonus = self.get_formation_modifier(
            personnel.formation, personnel.defensive_call, "pass"
        )
        
        completion_prob = (qb_rating + wr_rating) / (qb_rating + wr_rating + db_rating * 1.5)
        completion_prob *= formation_bonus
        
        # Enhanced simulation...
```

### 5. Updated PlayExecutor Flow

**New Integrated Flow:**
```python
def execute_play(self, offense_team: Dict, defense_team: Dict, game_state: GameState) -> PlayResult:
    # 1. Determine play type
    play_type = self._determine_play_type(game_state.field)
    
    # 2. Get personnel with current fatigue/injury state
    personnel = self.player_selector.get_personnel(
        offense_team, defense_team, play_type, game_state.field, self.config
    )
    
    # 3. Create play instance
    play_instance = PlayFactory.create_play(play_type, self.config)
    
    # 4. Simulate using personnel (fatigue affects performance)
    play_result = play_instance.simulate(personnel, game_state.field)
    
    # 5. Enrich result with analytical metadata
    self._enrich_play_result_with_metadata(play_result, personnel, game_state)
    
    # 6. Apply play-specific fatigue based on actual effort
    self.player_selector.apply_play_fatigue(personnel, play_result)
    
    return play_result
```

### 6. Method Naming Improvements

**Current vs Proposed:**
```python
# Before - unclear purpose
self._add_context_to_result(play_result, personnel, game_state)

# After - clear intent
self._enrich_play_result_with_metadata(play_result, personnel, game_state)
```

**Purpose Clarification:**
```python
def _enrich_play_result_with_metadata(self, play_result: PlayResult, 
                                     personnel: PersonnelPackage, game_state: GameState):
    """
    Enrich the play result with analytical metadata for statistics and reporting.
    
    This method adds contextual information that wasn't part of the core simulation
    but is needed for game analysis, play-by-play reporting, and statistical tracking.
    """
```

## Implementation Strategy
