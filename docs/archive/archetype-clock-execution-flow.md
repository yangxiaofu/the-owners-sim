## Step-by-Step Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Play Setup and Context Assembly

#### 1.1 PlayExecutor Initialization
```python
# Location: src/game_engine/core/play_executor.py:26
def execute_play(self, offense_team: Dict, defense_team: Dict, game_state: GameState) -> PlayResult:
```

**Process:**
1. PlayExecutor receives team data and current game state
2. Extracts offensive coordinator from team coaching staff
3. Attempts to get context-aware coordinator for current situation
4. Falls back to static archetype if dynamic coaching unavailable

#### 1.2 Coaching Staff Extraction
```python
# Lines 41-64 in play_executor.py
coaching_staff = offense_team.get('coaching_staff')
if coaching_staff:
    game_context = {
        'opponent': defense_team,
        'score_differential': game_state.get_score_differential(),
        'time_remaining': game_state.clock.get_time_remaining(),
        'field_position': game_state.field.field_position,
        'down': game_state.field.down,
        'yards_to_go': game_state.field.yards_to_go
    }
    offensive_coordinator = coaching_staff.get_offensive_coordinator_for_situation(
        game_state.field, game_context
    )
```

**Key Context Variables:**
- **opponent**: Defense team data for counter-adjustments
- **score_differential**: Point difference (positive if leading)
- **time_remaining**: Seconds left in current quarter
- **field_position**: Yard line (0-100)
- **down**: Current down (1-4)
- **yards_to_go**: Distance needed for first down

### Phase 2: Play Type Determination and Personnel Selection

#### 2.1 Play Type Selection
```python
# Line 65 in play_executor.py
play_type = self._determine_play_type(game_state.field, offensive_coordinator, defensive_coordinator)
```

**Process:**
1. PlayCaller.determine_play_type() called with archetype data
2. Situation classified (1st_and_10, 3rd_and_long, etc.)
3. Base probabilities retrieved from PlayCallingBalance configuration
4. Archetype modifiers applied from OFFENSIVE_ARCHETYPES matrix
5. Defensive influence applied if available
6. Contextual factors integrated
7. Weighted random selection made

#### 2.2 Personnel Package Selection
```python
# Lines 68-70 in play_executor.py
personnel = self.player_selector.get_personnel(
    offense_team, defense_team, play_type, game_state.field, self.config
)
```

### Phase 3: Play Execution

#### 3.1 Play Instance Creation
```python
# Line 76 in play_executor.py
play_instance = PlayFactory.create_play(play_type, self.config)
```

#### 3.2 Play Simulation
```python
# Line 79 in play_executor.py
play_result = play_instance.simulate(personnel, game_state.field)
```

**At this point, the play result contains:**
- `play_result.yards_gained`: Yards gained/lost on the play
- `play_result.play_type`: Type of play executed
- `play_result.success`: Whether play achieved its objective
- Additional outcome data

### Phase 4: Clock Management Execution

#### 4.1 Clock Strategy Manager Invocation
After play simulation, the system needs to determine time elapsed. This happens in the game orchestrator or through the play result processing:

```python
# Conceptual flow - actual integration point
archetype = offensive_coordinator.get('archetype', 'balanced')
time_elapsed = clock_strategy_manager.get_time_elapsed(
    archetype, play_type, game_context
)
```

#### 4.2 Strategy Selection with Fallback
```python
# Location: src/game_engine/coaching/clock/clock_strategy_manager.py:95-136
def get_time_elapsed(self, archetype: str, play_type: str, game_context: Dict[str, Any]) -> int:
    strategy = self._get_strategy_with_fallback(archetype)
    
    try:
        time_elapsed = strategy.get_time_elapsed(play_type, game_context)
        
        # Validation and bounds checking
        if not isinstance(time_elapsed, int) or time_elapsed < 0:
            return self._get_fallback_time(play_type, game_context)
            
        max_time = self._get_maximum_play_time(play_type, game_context)
        if time_elapsed > max_time:
            time_elapsed = max_time
            
        return time_elapsed
        
    except Exception as e:
        return self._get_fallback_time(play_type, game_context)
```

**Fallback Chain:**
1. **Primary**: Exact archetype match
2. **Secondary**: Archetype aliases (balanced_attack → balanced)
3. **Tertiary**: Balanced strategy fallback
4. **Ultimate**: Placeholder strategy with basic timing

#### 4.3 Strategy-Specific Time Calculation

Each archetype strategy follows this general pattern:

```python
# Example from RunHeavyStrategy
def get_time_elapsed(self, play_type: str, game_context: Dict[str, Any]) -> int:
    # Step 1: Base time by play type
    base_times = {
        'run': 28,      # Running plays consume more clock  
        'pass': 20,     # Passing plays
        'punt': 15,     # Special teams
        'field_goal': 15,
        'kneel': 40,    # Clock burning
        'spike': 3      # Clock stopping
    }
    base_time = base_times.get(play_type, 25)
    
    # Step 2: Archetype base adjustment
    base_adjustment = 4  # Run-heavy = +4 seconds base
    
    # Step 3: Play-type specific archetype modifiers
    play_modifiers = {
        'run': +2,      # Extra slow on run plays
        'pass': +1,     # Slightly slower on passes
    }
    
    # Step 4: Initial calculation
    adjusted_time = base_time + base_adjustment + play_modifiers.get(play_type, 0)
    
    # Step 5: Contextual adjustments (detailed below)
    # ... situational logic ...
    
    # Step 6: Apply bounds
    return max(8, min(45, adjusted_time))
```

### Phase 5: Contextual Adjustments

#### 5.1 Game Context Variable Extraction
```python
quarter = game_context.get('quarter', 1)
clock = game_context.get('clock', 900)
score_differential = game_context.get('score_differential', 0)
down = game_context.get('down', 1)
distance = game_context.get('distance', 10)
field_position = game_context.get('field_position', 20)
```

#### 5.2 Score Differential Logic
```python
# Leading by significant margin
if score_differential > 14:
    adjusted_time += 5  # Milk the clock
elif score_differential > 7:
    adjusted_time += 3  # Moderate clock control
elif score_differential > 0:
    adjusted_time += 1  # Slight clock awareness

# Trailing significantly
elif score_differential < -14:
    adjusted_time -= 4  # Desperate hurry-up
elif score_differential < -7:
    adjusted_time -= 2  # Moderate urgency
elif score_differential < 0:
    adjusted_time -= 1  # Slight urgency
```

#### 5.3 Quarter and Time-Based Adjustments
```python
# Fourth quarter situations
if quarter == 4:
    if clock < 120:  # Two-minute warning
        if score_differential > 0:
            adjusted_time += 3  # Run clock when leading
        elif score_differential < 0:
            adjusted_time -= 3  # Hurry up when trailing
    elif clock < 300:  # Final 5 minutes
        if score_differential > 7:
            adjusted_time += 2  # Clock control with lead
        elif score_differential < -7:
            adjusted_time -= 2  # Urgency when behind
```

#### 5.4 Down and Distance Modifiers
```python
# Third down urgency
if down == 3:
    if distance > 10:  # 3rd and long
        adjusted_time -= 1  # Slight urgency
    elif distance <= 3:  # 3rd and short
        adjusted_time += 1  # Take time for precision

# Fourth down decision making
if down == 4:
    adjusted_time += 2  # Extra time for critical decisions
```

#### 5.5 Field Position Considerations
```python
# Red zone precision
if field_position >= 80:  # Red zone
    adjusted_time += 2  # Extra time for precision near goal
    
# Deep territory caution  
elif field_position <= 20:  # Own territory
    adjusted_time += 1  # Slightly more careful
```

### Phase 6: Bounds Validation and Time Application

#### 6.1 Final Validation
```python
# Apply absolute bounds
time_elapsed = max(8, min(45, adjusted_time))

# Additional sanity checks in ClockStrategyManager
if not isinstance(time_elapsed, int) or time_elapsed < 0:
    return self._get_fallback_time(play_type, game_context)

max_time = self._get_maximum_play_time(play_type, game_context)
if time_elapsed > max_time:
    time_elapsed = max_time
```

#### 6.2 Clock Time Application
```python
# Location: src/game_engine/field/game_clock.py:24-30
def run_time(self, seconds: int):
    """Run time off the clock"""
    self.clock = max(0, self.clock - seconds)
    
    # Auto-advance quarter if clock expires
    if self.clock <= 0:
        self.advance_quarter()
```

## Archetype-Specific Behaviors

### Run Heavy Strategy
**Philosophy**: Ground and pound, clock control
```python
# Base adjustments: +4 seconds
# Run plays: +2 additional seconds
# When leading: +5 seconds in second half, +2 in first half
# When trailing by 7+: -2 seconds (slight urgency)
# Fourth quarter leading: +3 seconds (milk clock)
```

**Situational Behavior:**
- **Leading scenarios**: Maximum clock consumption
- **Close games**: Deliberate, methodical approach
- **Trailing significantly**: Reluctant urgency, still conservative
- **Red zone**: Extra precision time
- **Two-minute drill**: Minimal speed increase

### Air Raid Strategy
**Philosophy**: High tempo, maximum possessions
```python
# Base adjustments: -3 seconds
# Pass plays: -2 additional seconds  
# No-huddle situations: -5 seconds
# When trailing: -4 additional seconds
# Fourth quarter trailing: -6 seconds (maximum urgency)
```

**Situational Behavior:**
- **All situations**: Fast-paced execution
- **Trailing scenarios**: Extreme urgency
- **Leading scenarios**: Still fast tempo but slightly moderated
- **Two-minute drill**: Practiced efficiency, maximum speed
- **Red zone**: Quick strikes for touchdowns

### West Coast Strategy  
**Philosophy**: Precision passing, rhythm offense
```python
# Base adjustments: -1 second
# Pass plays: -1 additional second
# Complex routes: +1 second (precision required)
# Rhythm situations: -2 seconds (practiced timing)
# Red zone: +2 seconds (precision near goal)
```

**Situational Behavior:**
- **Rhythm plays**: Very efficient timing
- **Complex concepts**: Extra time for precision
- **Short yardage**: Quick, precise execution
- **Long yardage**: Methodical route development
- **Two-minute drill**: Practiced efficiency

### Balanced Strategy
**Philosophy**: Situational adaptation, neutral baseline
```python
# Base adjustments: 0 seconds (neutral)
# Situational modifiers only
# Score differential: ±2 seconds maximum
# Quarter-based: ±2 seconds maximum
# Down/distance: ±1 second maximum
```

**Situational Behavior:**
- **All situations**: Context-appropriate timing
- **No extreme tempo biases**: Relies on situation
- **Baseline comparison**: Standard NFL timing
- **Adaptable**: Changes based on game flow

### Conservative Strategy
**Philosophy**: Risk minimization, field position
```python
# Base adjustments: +2 seconds
# Precision emphasis: +1 second on critical downs
# When leading: +3 seconds (protect lead)
# Fourth down: +4 seconds (careful decisions)
# Red zone: +3 seconds (take field goals if needed)
```

**Situational Behavior:**
- **All situations**: Deliberate, careful execution
- **Leading scenarios**: Maximum clock protection
- **Critical downs**: Extra precision time
- **Special teams**: Conservative timing
- **Red zone**: Field goal mentality affects timing

### Aggressive Strategy
**Philosophy**: Maximum scoring, risk-taking
```python
# Base adjustments: -2 seconds
# Fourth down: +1 second (big decisions require thought)
# When trailing: -4 seconds (maximum urgency)
# Red zone: -1 second (go for touchdowns)
# Two-minute drill: -5 seconds (practiced aggression)
```

**Situational Behavior:**
- **Trailing scenarios**: Extreme urgency
- **Fourth down**: Quick but thoughtful decisions
- **Red zone**: Fast execution for touchdowns
- **Leading scenarios**: Moderate tempo reduction
- **Critical situations**: Aggressive but calculated

## Situational Adjustments

### Game Flow Situations

#### Leading by 14+ Points
**Philosophy**: Maximum clock control
```python
# All Archetypes Applied Modifiers:
run_heavy: +6 seconds    # Extreme clock milking
balanced: +3 seconds     # Standard clock control  
air_raid: +1 second      # Reluctant clock awareness
aggressive: +2 seconds   # Moderate adjustment
conservative: +4 seconds # Natural clock control
west_coast: +2 seconds   # Rhythm with clock awareness
```

#### Trailing by 14+ Points  
**Philosophy**: Maximum urgency
```python
# All Archetypes Applied Modifiers:
run_heavy: -2 seconds    # Reluctant urgency
balanced: -3 seconds     # Standard urgency
air_raid: -5 seconds     # Natural no-huddle tempo
aggressive: -4 seconds   # High urgency
conservative: -1 second  # Minimal urgency increase
west_coast: -3 seconds   # Efficient rhythm increase
```

#### Close Game (±7 points)
**Philosophy**: Situation-appropriate timing
```python
# Context-dependent modifiers based on other factors
# Quarter, down/distance, and field position become primary drivers
# Archetype modifiers reduced by 50% in close games
```

### Quarter-Based Adjustments

#### First Quarter
**Philosophy**: Establish tempo and rhythm
```python
# Minimal time pressure
# Full archetype personality expression
# Base modifiers applied at 100%
```

#### Second Quarter (Final 5 Minutes)
**Philosophy**: End-of-half management
```python
if clock < 300:  # Final 5 minutes
    if score_differential > 0:
        adjusted_time += 1  # Slight clock awareness
    elif score_differential < 0:
        adjusted_time -= 2  # Hurry-up for score
        
if clock < 120:  # Two-minute warning
    # Two-minute drill adjustments applied
    timeout_situations = True
```

#### Third Quarter
**Philosophy**: Second-half adjustments
```python
# Archetype modifiers increased by 25%
# Game plan adjustments based on halftime
# Clock awareness begins to factor in
```

#### Fourth Quarter
**Philosophy**: Game-decisive timing

**Final 10 Minutes (600 seconds):**
```python
if leading:
    clock_control_modifier = +2 to +4 seconds
elif trailing:
    urgency_modifier = -2 to -4 seconds
elif tied:
    precision_modifier = +1 second
```

**Final 5 Minutes (300 seconds):**
```python
if leading:
    extreme_clock_control = +3 to +6 seconds
elif trailing:
    high_urgency = -3 to -5 seconds
elif tied:
    situational_awareness = ±2 seconds
```

**Two-Minute Warning (120 seconds):**
```python
# Maximum modifiers applied
# Timeout management factors in
# Clock-stopping play awareness
if trailing:
    spike_awareness = True
    timeout_strategy = True
    maximum_urgency = -4 to -8 seconds
```

### Down and Distance Modifiers

#### First Down
```python
# 1st and 10: Establish rhythm
base_modifier = 0
if field_position < 20:  # Own territory
    caution_modifier = +1
elif field_position > 80:  # Red zone
    precision_modifier = +2

# 1st and Goal: Red zone precision
red_zone_modifier = +2 to +4 seconds
```

#### Second Down  
```python
# 2nd and short (1-3 yards)
power_situation = +1 second  # Physical plays need time

# 2nd and medium (4-7 yards)  
standard_modifier = 0

# 2nd and long (8+ yards)
passing_down = -1 second  # Slight urgency
```

#### Third Down
```python
# 3rd and short (1-3 yards)
conversion_precision = +2 seconds  # Critical conversion

# 3rd and medium (4-7 yards)
moderate_urgency = -1 second  # Need to convert

# 3rd and long (8+ yards)
passing_urgency = -2 seconds  # Obvious passing down
```

#### Fourth Down
```python
# All 4th down situations
decision_time = +3 seconds  # Major decision required

# 4th and 1-2 (go-for-it territory)
precision_time = +2 additional seconds

# 4th and 3+ (punt/FG territory)
special_teams_prep = +1 additional second
```

### Field Position Considerations

#### Own Territory (Field Position 1-20)
```python
conservative_approach = +2 seconds  # Extra caution
punt_awareness = +1 second  # Field position matters
safety_avoidance = +1 second  # Don't risk safety
```

#### Midfield (Field Position 21-49)
```python
standard_modifiers = 0  # Neutral field position
balanced_approach = True  # No significant adjustments
```

#### Opponent Territory (Field Position 50-79)
```python
scoring_opportunity = -1 second  # Slight urgency
red_zone_approach = +1 second  # Don't waste opportunity
```

#### Red Zone (Field Position 80-100)
```python
touchdown_precision = +3 seconds  # Precision is critical
goal_line_caution = +2 seconds  # Extra careful near goal
field_goal_decision = +1 second  # Settle for points?
```

#### Goal Line (Field Position 95-100)
```python
maximum_precision = +4 seconds  # Every yard critical
power_play_setup = +2 seconds  # Physical plays need setup
td_or_turnover = +3 seconds  # High-stakes situation
```

## Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

### Primary Error Detection

#### 6.1 Strategy Loading Failures
```python
# Location: clock_strategy_manager.py:42-66
def _initialize_placeholder_strategies(self):
    try:
        # Import actual strategy implementations
        from .strategies import (RunHeavyStrategy, AirRaidStrategy, ...)
        # Register actual strategies
    except ImportError:
        # Placeholder strategies not yet implemented
        self.logger.info("Clock strategies not yet implemented, using placeholder approach")
        self._register_placeholder_strategies()
```

**Fallback**: PlaceholderClockStrategy provides basic timing

#### 6.2 Invalid Time Values
```python
# Location: clock_strategy_manager.py:122-124
if not isinstance(time_elapsed, int) or time_elapsed < 0:
    self.logger.warning(f"Invalid time elapsed {time_elapsed}, using fallback")
    return self._get_fallback_time(play_type, game_context)
```

**Fallback**: Basic play-type timing with minimal context

#### 6.3 Excessive Time Values
```python
# Location: clock_strategy_manager.py:127-131
max_time = self._get_maximum_play_time(play_type, game_context)
if time_elapsed > max_time:
    self.logger.warning(f"Time elapsed {time_elapsed}s exceeds maximum {max_time}s, capping")
    time_elapsed = max_time
```

**Maximum Time Limits by Play Type:**
```python
max_times = {
    'run': 45,      # Very slow running play
    'pass': 35,     # Slow developing pass
    'punt': 30,     # Including snap time
    'field_goal': 30,
    'kneel': 45,    # Maximum kneel time
    'spike': 5      # Should be very quick
}
```

#### 6.4 Strategy Execution Exceptions
```python
# Location: clock_strategy_manager.py:134-136
except Exception as e:
    self.logger.error(f"Error calculating time elapsed for {archetype}: {e}")
    return self._get_fallback_time(play_type, game_context)
```

### Fallback Chain Architecture

#### Level 1: Exact Archetype Match
```python
if archetype in self._strategies:
    return self._strategies[archetype]
```

#### Level 2: Archetype Aliases
```python
archetype_aliases = {
    'balanced_attack': 'balanced',
    'conservative': 'balanced',
    'aggressive': 'balanced'
}

alias = archetype_aliases.get(archetype)
if alias and alias in self._strategies:
    return self._strategies[alias]
```

#### Level 3: Balanced Strategy Fallback
```python
if 'balanced' in self._strategies:
    self.logger.warning(f"Unknown archetype '{archetype}', falling back to balanced strategy")
    return self._strategies['balanced']
```

#### Level 4: Placeholder Strategy
```python
self.logger.warning(f"No strategy available for '{archetype}', using placeholder")
return _PlaceholderClockStrategy()
```

### Fallback Time Calculation

#### Basic Play Type Timing
```python
# Location: clock_strategy_manager.py:167-175
base_times = {
    'run': 25,      # Running plays consume more clock
    'pass': 15,     # Passing plays vary but shorter on average
    'punt': 10,     # Special teams plays
    'field_goal': 10,
    'kneel': 40,    # Kneeling to run clock
    'spike': 2      # Clock stoppers
}
base_time = base_times.get(play_type, 20)  # Default 20 seconds
```

#### Minimal Context Adjustments
```python
# Timeout situation override
if game_context.get('timeout_situation'):
    return 2  # Minimal time if timeout called

# Two-minute warning urgency
quarter = game_context.get('quarter', 1)
clock = game_context.get('clock', 900)

if quarter in [2, 4] and clock < 120:  # Two minute warning
    return max(base_time - 5, 5)  # 5-second reduction, minimum 5 seconds
```

### Error Recovery Logging

#### Debug Logging
```python
self.logger.debug(f"Registered clock strategy for archetype: {archetype}")
```

#### Warning Logging
```python
self.logger.warning(f"Invalid time elapsed {time_elapsed} from {archetype} strategy, using fallback")
self.logger.warning(f"Unknown archetype '{archetype}', falling back to balanced strategy")
self.logger.warning(f"Time elapsed {time_elapsed}s exceeds maximum {max_time}s, capping")
```

#### Error Logging
```python
self.logger.error(f"Error calculating time elapsed for {archetype}: {e}")
```

### Graceful Degradation Strategy

1. **Full System**: All archetypes loaded, context-aware decisions
2. **Partial System**: Some archetypes loaded, fallbacks for missing ones
3. **Basic System**: Only balanced/placeholder strategies, minimal context
4. **Emergency System**: Hardcoded timing values, no archetype consideration

## Integration Points

### 7.1 PlayExecutor Integration
```python
# Location: src/game_engine/core/play_executor.py
# Current: Direct play execution without clock management
# Future: Clock strategy integration point

def execute_play(self, offense_team, defense_team, game_state):
    # ... existing play execution ...
    
    # INTEGRATION POINT: Clock management
    archetype = offensive_coordinator.get('archetype', 'balanced')
    
    # Get clock strategy manager (needs to be added)
    if not hasattr(self, 'clock_strategy_manager'):
        from ..coaching.clock.clock_strategy_manager import ClockStrategyManager
        self.clock_strategy_manager = ClockStrategyManager()
    
    # Calculate time elapsed
    game_context = self._build_clock_context(game_state, offensive_coordinator)

## Conclusion

This archetype clock execution flow system provides a comprehensive framework for realistic, coaching-archetype-driven time management in football simulation. The system is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for future enhancements while maintaining robust error handling and performance characteristics.

The modular design allows for independent testing and validation of each component, while the Strategy pattern ensures easy addition of new coaching archetypes without modifying existing code. The comprehensive fallback system ensures the game remains playable even when individual components fail.

Future development should focus on integration with the existing codebase, performance optimization, and the addition of more sophisticated contextual factors as the simulation system evolves.
