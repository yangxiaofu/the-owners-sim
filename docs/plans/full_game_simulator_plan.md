# Full Game Simulator Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement the `simulate_game()` method in `FullGameSimulator` to orchestrate a complete NFL game simulation using all existing components. The simulator will manage game flow, track comprehensive statistics, and provide public APIs for external access to game stats, player stats, and team stats.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Components âœ…
Based on analysis of the codebase, these components are already built and functional:

- `DriveManager` - individual drive simulation and field position tracking
- `GameClock` - time management and quarter transitions
- `Scoreboard` - score tracking and game phase management
- `PossessionManager` - tracks which team has the ball

**Play Execution Engine:**
- `PlayEngine` (engine.py) - main play simulation orchestrator
- All play simulators: `RunPlaySimulator`, `PassPlaySimulator`, `PuntSimulator`, `FieldGoalSimulator`, `KickoffSimulator`
- `PlayResult` - unified play outcome structure

### Phase 5: Game Flow Decision Integration
**Integrate coaching decisions with game context:**
- Use existing fourth down decision matrix with game situation
- Clock management integration with `GameClock` and score differential
- Situational play calling based on game phase and score
- Timeout and challenge decisions based on game state

## Key Technical Considerations

### Statistics Flow Architecture
```
PlayResult (individual play) 
  â†’ PlayerStats (play-level player contributions)
  â†’ PlayerStatsAccumulator (player season/game totals)
  â†’ TeamStatsAccumulator (team-level aggregation)
  â†’ CentralizedStatsAggregator (game-level consolidation)
  â†’ GameStatsReporter (final game report)
  â†’ PublicAPILayer (external access)
```

### Game Flow State Machine
```
PREGAME â†’ FIRST_QUARTER â†’ SECOND_QUARTER â†’ HALFTIME â†’ 
THIRD_QUARTER â†’ FOURTH_QUARTER â†’ [OVERTIME] â†’ FINAL
```

Each quarter contains multiple drives:
```
Quarter Start â†’ Kickoff â†’ Drive â†’ Score/Punt/Turnover â†’ 
Next Possession â†’ Repeat â†’ Quarter End
```

### Integration Points
1. **Play Execution Integration:** Each play execution must feed statistics into the aggregation system
2. **Drive Management:** Drive results must update game-level statistics and determine next possession
3. **Game State Coordination:** Clock, score, and possession must stay synchronized
4. **Coaching Decision Integration:** Game situation must influence play calling decisions

### Critical Bug Fix Required
Based on existing analysis in `docs/plans/dongs_simulation_flow.md`, there's a critical bug in special teams situation classification:
- `CoachingStaff._extract_situation()` never detects `down == 4` situations  
- This breaks punt, field goal, and fourth down play calling
- Must be fixed for complete game simulation to work properly

**Fix Required in `src/play_engine/play_calling/coaching_staff.py`:**
```python
def _extract_situation(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    down = context.get('down', 1)
    yards_to_go = context.get('yards_to_go', 10)
    
    # FIX: Add missing fourth down logic
    if down == 4:
        return 'fourth_down'
    
    # Existing logic...
    if down == 3:
        return 'third_and_long' if yards_to_go >= 7 else 'third_and_short'
    elif down == 1:
        return 'first_down'
    else:
        return 'second_down'
```

## Data Structures

### GameResult
```python
@dataclass
class GameResult:
    home_team: Team
    away_team: Team
    final_score: Dict[int, int]
    winner: Optional[Team]
    game_stats: GameStatsReport
    drive_results: List[DriveResult]
    total_plays: int
    total_time: str
    attendance: Optional[int] = None
```

### DriveResult  
```python
@dataclass
class DriveResult:
    possessing_team_id: int
    starting_field_position: FieldPosition
    ending_field_position: FieldPosition
    drive_outcome: DriveEndReason
    plays: List[PlayResult]
    drive_stats: DriveStats
    time_elapsed: int
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Use generators for play-by-play iteration where possible
- Clear intermediate data structures after drive completion
- Lazy loading of detailed statistics until requested

### Simulation Speed
- Target: ~1-2 seconds per simulated game
- Batch statistics updates rather than individual play updates
- Cache frequently accessed coaching decisions

### Scalability
- Design APIs to support multiple concurrent game simulations
- Separate statistics aggregation from game simulation logic
- Enable statistics export in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, etc.)
