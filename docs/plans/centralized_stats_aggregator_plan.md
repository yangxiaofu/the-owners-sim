# CentralizedStatsAggregator Implementation Plan

## Overview
Design and implement the CentralizedStatsAggregator as a statistics coordination hub that bridges GameLoopController output with existing statistics components, providing unified access to all game statistics.

## Current Statistics Architecture Analysis

### Existing Components âœ…
1. **`PlayerStats`** - Individual player statistics for single plays (comprehensive stat tracking)
2. **`PlayStatsSummary`** - Container for all PlayerStats from one play with penalty info
3. **`PlayerStatsAccumulator`** - Accumulates player stats across entire game (proven, tested)
4. **`TeamStatsAccumulator`** - Accumulates team-level stats from plays (proven, tested)
5. **`GameStatsReporter`** - Final comprehensive reporting system

### Current Data Flow âœ…
```
Play Simulators â†’ PlayStatsSummary â†’ PlayerStatsAccumulator/TeamStatsAccumulator
```

### The Missing Link ðŸ”¨
**Problem:** GameLoopController receives `PlayResult` (basic) but existing accumulators expect `PlayStatsSummary` (detailed).

**Current Gap:**
```
GameLoopController._run_play() â†’ PlayResult (basic: yards, outcome, time)
??? Missing Bridge ???
PlayerStatsAccumulator.add_play_stats() expects PlayStatsSummary (detailed: player stats)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Statistics Disconnect
Looking at the current implementation:

1. **Play Simulators** (RunPlaySimulator, PassPlaySimulator, etc.) **already generate rich PlayerStats**
2. **PlayEngine.simulate()** returns only basic `PlayResult` - **detailed stats are lost!**
3. **GameLoopController** only receives basic play outcome
4. **Existing accumulators** never receive the detailed statistics they were designed for

### The Solution: Bridge the Gap
The CentralizedStatsAggregator serves as the missing bridge by:
1. **Enhancing PlayResult** to include detailed statistics
2. **Coordinating existing components** rather than replacing them
3. **Adding game-level tracking** that's currently missing
4. **Providing unified API** for external access

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core CentralizedStatsAggregator

**Location:** `src/game_management/centralized_stats_aggregator.py`

**Role:** Statistics coordination hub - **not a replacement, but an orchestrator**

### Enhanced PlayResult Structure
```python
@dataclass
class PlayResult:
    # Existing basic fields
    outcome: str
    yards_gained: int
    time_elapsed: float
    is_touchdown: bool = False
    is_field_goal: bool = False
    is_punt: bool = False
    is_turnover: bool = False
    
    # NEW: Include rich statistics (the missing link!)
    detailed_stats: Optional[PlayStatsSummary] = None
    penalty_info: Optional[PenaltyInstance] = None
```

### GameLevelStats Class
```python
@dataclass
class GameLevelStats:
    """Game-wide statistics not tracked by player/team accumulators"""
    total_plays: int = 0
    total_drives: int = 0
    quarters_completed: int = 0
    game_time_elapsed: int = 0  # seconds
    total_penalties: int = 0
    total_penalty_yards: int = 0
    
    # Advanced game-level tracking
    red_zone_attempts: Dict[int, int] = field(default_factory=dict)  # team_id -> attempts
    red_zone_scores: Dict[int, int] = field(default_factory=dict)    # team_id -> scores
    third_down_attempts: Dict[int, int] = field(default_factory=dict)
    third_down_conversions: Dict[int, int] = field(default_factory=dict)
    fourth_down_attempts: Dict[int, int] = field(default_factory=dict)
    fourth_down_conversions: Dict[int, int] = field(default_factory=dict)
    turnovers: Dict[int, int] = field(default_factory=dict)  # team_id -> turnovers committed
    time_of_possession: Dict[int, int] = field(default_factory=dict)  # team_id -> seconds
```

## Integration with GameLoopController

### Required Changes to GameLoopController
```python
class GameLoopController:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # Existing initialization...
        
        # NEW: Replace individual accumulators with centralized coordinator
        self.stats_aggregator = CentralizedStatsAggregator(
            home_team_id=home_team.team_id,
            away_team_id=away_team.team_id,
            game_identifier=f"{away_team.abbreviation}_vs_{home_team.abbreviation}"
        )
        
        # Remove old individual components (now coordinated by CentralizedStatsAggregator)
        # self.player_stats = PlayerStatsAccumulator()  # REMOVE
        # self.team_stats = TeamStatsAccumulator()      # REMOVE
    
    def _run_play(self, drive_manager, possessing_team_id) -> PlayResult:
        # Get current drive situation for statistics context
        current_situation = drive_manager.get_current_situation()
        down = current_situation.down
        yards_to_go = current_situation.yards_to_go
        field_position = drive_manager.field_tracker.current_position.yard_line
        
        # Existing play execution...
        play_result = simulate(play_params)
        
        # NEW: Record comprehensive statistics
        self.stats_aggregator.record_play_result(
            play_result, 
            possessing_team_id,
            down,
            yards_to_go,
            field_position
        )
        
        return play_result
    
    def _run_quarter(self, quarter: int) -> None:
        # Existing quarter logic...
        
        # NEW: Record quarter completion
        self.stats_aggregator.record_quarter_end(quarter)
    
    def _run_drive(self, possessing_team_id: int) -> DriveResult:
        # Existing drive logic...
        drive_result = # ... existing drive execution
        
        # NEW: Record drive statistics
        self.stats_aggregator.record_drive_result(drive_result)
        
        return drive_result
```

### Required Changes to PlayEngine/Simulators
The key missing piece - simulators need to populate `detailed_stats` in `PlayResult`:

```python
# In each simulator (RunPlaySimulator, PassPlaySimulator, etc.)
def simulate_run_play(self, context: Optional[PlayContext] = None) -> PlayResult:
    # Existing simulation logic that creates PlayStatsSummary
    play_stats_summary = # ... existing detailed stats creation
    
    # NEW: Include detailed stats in PlayResult
    return PlayResult(
        outcome=play_stats_summary.play_type,
        yards_gained=play_stats_summary.yards_gained,
        time_elapsed=play_stats_summary.time_elapsed,
        is_touchdown=(play_stats_summary.yards_gained >= yards_to_goal_line),
        # ... other basic fields
        
        # THE MISSING LINK: Include detailed statistics!
        detailed_stats=play_stats_summary,
        penalty_info=play_stats_summary.penalty_instance if play_stats_summary.penalty_occurred else None
    )
```

## Implementation Dependencies

### Phase 1 Requirements:
1. âœ… **PlayResult enhancement** - Add `detailed_stats` and `penalty_info` fields
2. âœ… **GameLevelStats class** - New data structure for game-wide tracking
3. âœ… **CentralizedStatsAggregator class** - Core coordinator implementation  
4. ðŸ”¨ **Play simulator updates** - Populate detailed stats in PlayResult
5. ðŸ”¨ **GameLoopController integration** - Use CentralizedStatsAggregator instead of individual components

### Testing Strategy:
1. **Unit tests for GameLevelStats** - Verify statistical calculations
2. **Unit tests for CentralizedStatsAggregator** - Test coordination logic  
3. **Integration tests** - Verify end-to-end statistics flow
4. **Statistics accuracy validation** - Compare with known expected outcomes

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:
1. âœ… CentralizedStatsAggregator successfully coordinates existing PlayerStatsAccumulator and TeamStatsAccumulator
2. âœ… Game-level statistics (red zone, third down, etc.) are accurately tracked
3. âœ… Public API methods provide unified access to all statistics
4. âœ… Integration with GameLoopController feeds comprehensive statistics
5. âœ… No duplication - existing proven components are leveraged, not replaced
6. âœ… Unit tests validate all statistical calculations and coordinations

### Key Validation Tests:
- Run a simulated game and verify player statistics match expected totals
- Verify team statistics aggregate correctly from individual plays
- Confirm game-level statistics (red zone efficiency, conversion rates) calculate accurately
- Validate that no statistics are lost in the coordination process

This approach bridges the current statistics gap while leveraging all existing, proven components to create a comprehensive statistics tracking system.
