# NFL Roster Update Plans

This document outlines the comprehensive plan and methodology for updating NFL team rosters in "The Owners Sim" project, documenting the research process, file structure standards, and implementation guidelines.

## Project Overview

### Purpose
Create detailed roster documentation for all 32 NFL teams in the simulation, providing comprehensive player data that integrates seamlessly with the game's player management and simulation systems.

### Scope
- **Documentation**: Detailed markdown files for each team's 53-man roster
- **Data Integration**: Individual JSON files per team for modular player data management
- **Standardization**: Consistent format and attribute systems across all teams
- **Maintenance**: Guidelines for keeping rosters current with real NFL changes

### Current Status
- âœ… **Cleveland Browns** (Team ID: 7) - Complete roster documentation and player data
- âœ… **Buffalo Bills** (Team ID: 1) - Complete roster documentation and player data
- âœ… **Miami Dolphins** (Team ID: 2) - Complete roster documentation and player data
- ðŸ”„ **Remaining Teams**: 29 teams pending implementation

## Research Methodology

### Data Sources
Primary sources for roster information include:
1. **Official Team Websites** - Most current roster information
2. **NFL.com** - Official league roster data and statistics
3. **ESPN** - Comprehensive player statistics and injury reports
4. **Pro Football Reference** - Historical performance data and advanced metrics
5. **Sports Illustrated** - Depth chart analysis and roster breakdowns

### Information Gathering Process
1. **Current Roster Validation** - Verify 53-man roster composition
2. **Player Details Collection** - Names, jersey numbers, positions, college background
3. **Performance Analysis** - 2024 season statistics and performance metrics
4. **Experience Assessment** - Years in NFL, team tenure, leadership roles
5. **Attribute Estimation** - Based on performance data and positional requirements

### Quality Assurance
- Cross-reference multiple sources for accuracy
- Validate jersey numbers and position assignments
- Ensure roster composition matches NFL standards (position limits, total players)
- Verify no duplicate player entries within team

## Data Integration Process

### Modular Team-Based JSON Structure (`src/data/teams/`)

#### New Architecture Overview
Each NFL team has its own dedicated JSON file for improved modularity, maintainability, and performance:

## Implementation Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Phase 1: Research and Documentation
1. **Select Target Team** from remaining 29 teams
2. **Gather Current Roster Data** from primary sources
3. **Cross-Reference Information** across multiple sources
4. **Create Roster Documentation** following template structure
5. **Review and Validate** completeness and accuracy

#### Phase 2: Team JSON File Creation
1. **Create Team Directory Structure** if not exists (`src/data/teams/`)
2. **Generate Team-Specific JSON File** following naming convention (`team_[id]_[name].json`)
3. **Calculate Player ID Range** using team-based allocation (team_id * 100)
4. **Create Player Entries** for all 53 players within team range
5. **Assign Appropriate Attributes** based on performance and position
6. **Validate JSON Structure** and syntax
7. **Update Team Metadata** (total_players count, team info, version)

#### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
1. **Test Player Loading** in simulation system
2. **Verify Team ID Mapping** and player associations
3. **Cross-Check Roster Completeness** (all positions covered)
4. **Review Attribute Consistency** across similar players
5. **Document Any Special Considerations** or known issues

### Batch Processing Strategy
- **AFC Divisions First**: Complete AFC teams before moving to NFC
- **Division Groups**: Process teams within same division together for rivalry context
- **Priority Teams**: Focus on playoff teams and popular franchises first
- **Quality Over Speed**: Ensure each team is thoroughly researched and documented

---

## Maintenance Schedule

### Regular Updates
- **Weekly During Season**: Injury reports and roster moves
- **Monthly During Offseason**: Free agency and trade updates
- **Post-Draft**: Rookie additions and roster cuts
- **Pre-Season**: Final 53-man roster adjustments

### Seasonal Milestones
1. **NFL Draft** (April/May) - Add rookie players
2. **Training Camp** (July/August) - Update depth charts
3. **Roster Cuts** (September) - Finalize 53-man rosters
4. **Trade Deadline** (November) - Mid-season roster changes
5. **Free Agency** (March) - Major roster turnover

### Version Control
- **Document Dates**: Update "Last Updated" field in all roster files
- **Change Tracking**: Note major roster changes in documentation
- **Backup Strategy**: Maintain previous versions for reference
- **Player ID Preservation**: Never reuse player IDs from removed players

## Technical Considerations

### New Modular Architecture Advantages
- **Reduced File Size**: Individual team files (~53 players) vs. single massive file (~1,700 players)
- **Faster Loading**: Load only required teams for simulation rather than entire league
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple teams can be updated simultaneously without conflicts
- **Easier Maintenance**: Team-specific updates don't affect other teams' data
- **Version Control**: Git-friendly smaller files with cleaner diffs and merge conflicts
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of practice squads, IR lists, and historical rosters per team

### Modular File Management
- **Directory Structure**: Organized `/teams/` directory with consistent naming
- **Individual Validation**: Each team file can be validated independently
- **Incremental Updates**: Update only changed teams during roster moves
- **Backup Strategy**: Team-specific backups and rollback capabilities
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track individual file sizes and loading times

### Integration Points
- **Team Roster Loader**: Update to dynamically load from team-specific files
- **Simulation Engine**: Validate all attributes are utilized properly across modular structure
- **Database API**: Enhance to retrieve players from appropriate team files
- **Statistics System**: Verify player stats attribution works with distributed data
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement team-based caching for frequently accessed rosters

### Error Handling
- **File-Level Validation**: Validate each team file independently
- **Cross-Team Consistency**: Ensure player IDs don't conflict across teams
- **Missing Team Files**: Graceful handling of missing team data
- **JSON Schema Validation**: Consistent structure validation across all team files
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Verify team metadata matches player team_id assignments

### Migration Strategy
- **Legacy Support**: Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- **Data Conversion**: Scripts to migrate from consolidated to modular format
- **Testing Framework**: Validate data integrity across old and new formats
- **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert to consolidated format if issues arise
