```

### Position-Specific Discipline Baselines

| Position Group | Discipline Range | Penalty Tendency |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Offensive Line | 65-80 | Higher (holding, false start) |
| Wide Receivers | 75-90 | Lower (fewer penalties) |
| Defensive Backs | 70-85 | Moderate (PI, holding) |
| Linebackers | 70-85 | Moderate (roughness) |
| Defensive Line | 65-80 | Higher (offside, roughness) |
| Running Backs | 75-90 | Lower (fewer penalties) |
| Quarterbacks | 85-95 | Very low (delay of game) |

## 4. Penalty Detection Logic

### Core Detection Algorithm

```python
def detect_penalty(penalty_type: str, base_player: Player, situational_modifiers: Dict) -> Optional[Penalty]:
    # Base penalty rate for this type
    base_rate = PENALTY_RATES[penalty_type]['base_rate']
    
    # Player discipline factor (0-100 scale, higher = fewer penalties)
    discipline_factor = base_player.discipline / 100.0
    discipline_modifier = 2.0 - discipline_factor  # Range: 1.0 to 2.0
    
    # Situational modifiers
    situation_modifier = 1.0
    for situation, modifier in situational_modifiers.items():
        situation_modifier *= modifier
    
    # Final penalty probability
    final_rate = base_rate * discipline_modifier * situation_modifier
    
    # Random roll
    if random.random() < final_rate:
        return Penalty(penalty_type, base_player, PENALTY_YARDS[penalty_type])
    
    return None
```

### Situational Modifier Examples

```python
SITUATIONAL_MODIFIERS = {
    'red_zone': 1.15,           # +15% penalty rate in red zone
    'fourth_down': 1.10,        # +10% penalty rate on 4th down  
    'two_minute_drill': 1.20,   # +20% penalty rate in 2-minute drill
    'goal_line': 1.25,          # +25% penalty rate on goal line
    'road_game': 1.08,          # +8% penalty rate on road
    'rivalry_game': 1.12,       # +12% penalty rate in rivalry games
    'playoff_game': 0.95,       # -5% penalty rate in playoffs (discipline)
}
```

## 5. Data Structures

### Penalty Class

**Location**: `src/game_engine/penalties/data_structures.py`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Penalty:
    """Immutable penalty occurrence"""
    penalty_type: str              # "holding", "false_start", etc.
    penalized_player: str          # Player who committed penalty  
    penalty_yards: int             # Yardage assessment
    automatic_first_down: bool     # Whether penalty grants automatic first down
    phase: str                     # "pre_snap", "during_play", "post_play"
    description: str               # Human-readable description
    
    def get_enforcement_summary(self) -> str:
        """Generate penalty enforcement description"""
        summary = f"{self.penalty_type.title()} on #{self.penalized_player}"
        if self.automatic_first_down:
            summary += f", {self.penalty_yards} yards, automatic first down"  
        else:
            summary += f", {self.penalty_yards} yard penalty"
        return summary
```

### Enhanced PlayResult

**Location**: `src/game_engine/plays/data_structures.py`

```python
@dataclass  
class PlayResult:
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # === PENALTY TRACKING ===
    penalty_occurred: bool = False
    penalty_type: Optional[str] = None
    penalized_player: Optional[str] = None
    penalty_yards: int = 0
    penalty_automatic_first_down: bool = False
    penalty_phase: Optional[str] = None  # pre_snap, during_play, post_play
    penalty_description: str = ""
    
    # Multiple penalties support  
    additional_penalties: List[Penalty] = field(default_factory=list)
```

## 6. Integration Points

### PlayExecutor Integration

**Location**: `src/game_engine/core/play_executor.py`

```python
class PlayExecutor:
    def __init__(self, config: Dict = None):
        # ... existing initialization ...
        self.penalty_detector = PenaltyDetector()
    
    def execute_play(self, offense_team: Dict, defense_team: Dict, game_state: GameState) -> PlayResult:
        # === PHASE 1: PRE-SNAP PENALTIES ===
        pre_snap_penalty = self.penalty_detector.check_pre_snap_penalties(
            offense_team, defense_team, game_state
        )
        if pre_snap_penalty:
            return self._create_penalty_play_result(pre_snap_penalty)
        
        # === NORMAL PLAY EXECUTION ===
        # ... existing play execution logic ...
        play_result = play_instance.simulate(personnel, game_state.field)
        
        # === PHASE 2: DURING-PLAY PENALTIES ===
        during_play_penalty = self.penalty_detector.check_during_play_penalties(
            play_result, personnel, game_state
        )
        if during_play_penalty:
            play_result = self._merge_penalty_with_play(play_result, during_play_penalty)
        
        # === PHASE 3: POST-PLAY PENALTIES ===
        post_play_penalty = self.penalty_detector.check_post_play_penalties(
            play_result, personnel, game_state
        )
        if post_play_penalty:
            play_result = self._add_post_play_penalty(play_result, post_play_penalty)
        
        return play_result
```

| Penalties per game (per team) | 7.56 | 6.5 - 8.5 |
| Penalty yards per game (per team) | 51.83 | 45 - 60 |
| Most common penalties | Holding, False Start, PI | Match distribution |
| Penalty phase distribution | ~40% pre-snap, ~50% during, ~10% post | Match timing |

### Testing Framework

**Location**: `tests/penalty_benchmarking_suite.py`

```python
class PenaltyBenchmarkingTest:
    def test_100_game_penalty_rates(self):
        """Run 100 simulated games and validate penalty statistics"""
        total_penalties = 0
        total_yards = 0
        games_simulated = 100
        
        for game_num in range(games_simulated):
            game_penalties, game_penalty_yards = self.simulate_full_game()
            total_penalties += game_penalties
            total_yards += game_penalty_yards
        
        avg_penalties_per_game = total_penalties / games_simulated
        avg_penalty_yards_per_game = total_yards / games_simulated
        
        # Validate against NFL benchmarks
        assert 6.5 <= avg_penalties_per_game <= 8.5, f"Penalty rate {avg_penalties_per_game} outside NFL range"
        assert 45 <= avg_penalty_yards_per_game <= 60, f"Penalty yards {avg_penalty_yards_per_game} outside NFL range"
    
    def test_penalty_distribution_by_type(self):
        """Validate penalty type distribution matches NFL patterns"""
        # Test holding is most common (~25% of all penalties)
        # Test false start is common (~18% of all penalties)  
        # Test pass interference occurs at realistic rates
    
    def test_situational_penalty_rates(self):
        """Validate penalties occur more in high-pressure situations"""
        # Test red zone penalty rate increase
        # Test 4th down penalty rate increase
        # Test 2-minute drill penalty rate increase
```

- **Game Balance**: Penalties could break game flow
  - *Mitigation*: Conservative penalty rates, extensive testing
- **Complexity Creep**: Feature could become overly complex
  - *Mitigation*: YAGNI approach, phase-limited implementation

### Testing Risks  
- **Statistical Variance**: 100 games may not be sufficient sample
  - *Mitigation*: Run multiple 100-game suites, use confidence intervals
- **NFL Data Changes**: 2024 NFL stats may not be representative
  - *Mitigation*: Use multi-year averages for validation

---

## 10. Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
1. **Penalty Rate Accuracy**: Within ±1 penalty per game of NFL average
2. **Penalty Yard Accuracy**: Within ±5 yards per game of NFL average  
3. **Performance Impact**: < 5% increase in simulation time
4. **Test Coverage**: > 95% code coverage on penalty system

### Qualitative Metrics
1. **Realism**: Penalties feel natural and appropriately timed
2. **Balance**: Penalties don't dominate or disappear from games
3. **Variety**: Different penalty types occur with realistic frequency
4. **Player Impact**: Discipline attribute meaningfully affects penalty rates
