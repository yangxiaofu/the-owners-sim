        week_start = self.season_start + timedelta(weeks=week-1)
        # Adjust to Sunday
        days_to_sunday = (6 - week_start.weekday()) % 7
        sunday = week_start + timedelta(days=days_to_sunday)
        
        # Map time slot to specific datetime
        if time_slot == TimeSlot.THURSDAY_NIGHT:
            game_date = sunday - timedelta(days=3)  # Previous Thursday
            return datetime.combine(game_date, datetime.strptime("20:20", "%H:%M").time())
        elif time_slot == TimeSlot.SUNDAY_EARLY:

        cls._team_id = team_id
        cls._season_year = season_year
        return cls._dynasty_id
    
    @classmethod
    def get_dynasty_id(cls) -> str:
        if cls._dynasty_id is None:

        cls._dynasty_id = None
        cls._team_id = None
        cls._season_year = None
```

**Test Script**: `test_dynasty_context.py`
```python
from dynasty_context import DynastyContext

## Gap #1 Resolution Details (December 2024)

### Problem Analysis
Gap #1's core issue was **integration mismatches**, not missing code. The SeasonInitializer existed but couldn't connect components due to incorrect assumptions about their interfaces.

### Fixes Implemented

#### 1. CalendarManager Integration Fix
**File**: `src/simulation/season_initializer.py` (line 276-281)
```python
# BEFORE (WRONG):
calendar = CalendarManager(
    store_manager=self.store_manager,  # ❌ Invalid parameter
    daily_persister=self.daily_persister
)

# AFTER (CORRECT):
calendar = CalendarManager(
    start_date=start_date,  # ✅ Required first parameter
    season_year=self.dynasty_context.get_season_year(),
    daily_persister=self.daily_persister,
    enable_result_processing=False
)
```

#### 2. GameSimulationEvent Import
**File**: `src/simulation/season_initializer.py` (line 43-46)
```python
try:
    from simulation.events.game_simulation_event import GameSimulationEvent
except ImportError:
    GameSimulationEvent = None
```

#### 3. Actual Event Scheduling Implementation
**File**: `src/simulation/season_initializer.py` (line 291-373)
```python
def _schedule_games_in_calendar(self) -> int:
    # Get all assigned games from schedule
    assigned_games = self.schedule.get_assigned_games()
    
    for game in assigned_games:
        # Map time slot to date/time
        game_dates = self.date_calculator.get_game_dates_for_week(game.week)
        
        # Create GameSimulationEvent
        event = GameSimulationEvent(
            date=game_datetime,
            away_team_id=game.away_team_id,
            home_team_id=game.home_team_id,
            week=game.week
        )
        
        # Schedule in calendar
        success, msg = self.calendar_manager.schedule_event(event)
```

#### 4. Database Parameter Fixes
- DailyDataPersister: `db_connection` → `database_connection`
- dynasty_seasons table: Removed non-existent columns
- Proper date calculation using WeekToDateCalculator

### Test Results
**File**: `test_gap1_fixes.py`
```
✅ CalendarManager Creation: PASSED
✅ GameSimulationEvent Import: PASSED
✅ Season Initialization: PASSED
✅ Day Simulation: PASSED
```

### Impact
With Gap #1 resolved, the system can now:
1. Initialize a complete NFL season
2. Schedule 160+ games with correct dates/times
3. Simulate any day and execute scheduled games
4. Persist results to database
5. Track dynasty progress

**Gap #1 Status**: ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED**

## NEW: Scheduling Conflict Resolution 🚨 CRITICAL

### The Problem
The PerfectScheduler successfully generates all 272 games with each team playing exactly 17 games. However, when converting these games to calendar events, only 165/272 games can be scheduled due to conflicts where teams are assigned multiple games in the same week.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Template Approach**: PerfectScheduler uses simple template filling - it assigns matchups to slots sequentially
2. **No Week Validation**: The template doesn't check if a team already plays in a given week
3. **Random Assignment**: Matchups are shuffled and assigned randomly to slots

### Example Conflict
```
Week 1, Sunday 1PM: Team 10 @ Team 24  ✅ Scheduled
Week 1, Sunday 1PM: Team 30 @ Team 32  ✅ Scheduled  
Week 1, Sunday 1PM: Team 19 @ Team 24  ❌ CONFLICT - Team 24 already plays Team 10
```

### Solution Approach

#### Option 1: Smart Template Assignment (Recommended)
Modify PerfectScheduler to use week-aware assignment:
```python
def schedule_matchups_smart(self, matchups, template):
    week_assignments = {week: set() for week in range(1, 19)}
    assigned_games = []
    
    for slot in template:
        week = slot['week']
        teams_this_week = week_assignments[week]
        
        # Find a matchup where neither team plays this week
        for matchup in available_matchups:
            home, away = matchup
            if home not in teams_this_week and away not in teams_this_week:
                # Assign this matchup to this slot
                assigned_games.append((slot, matchup))
                teams_this_week.add(home)
                teams_this_week.add(away)
                available_matchups.remove(matchup)
                break
```

#### Option 2: Constraint-Based Scheduler
Return to constraint solving but with simplified constraints:
- Each team plays exactly once per week
- Each team plays 17 games total
- Ignore complex NFL rules for MVP

#### Option 3: Pre-Built NFL Template
Use actual NFL schedule structure from recent years as template:
- Research 2023-2024 schedules
- Extract week-by-week team assignments
- Apply same pattern to generated matchups

### Implementation Plan
1. **Quick Fix** (1 hour): Add week validation to PerfectScheduler
2. **Test** (30 min): Verify all 272 games schedule without conflicts
3. **Refine** (30 min): Ensure home/away balance

### Success Metrics
- ✅ All 272 games scheduled in calendar
- ✅ No team plays more than once per week
- ✅ Each team plays exactly 17 games
- ✅ Games distributed across 18 weeks

    def convert_schedule(self, schedule: SeasonSchedule) -> List[GameSimulationEvent]:
        events = []
        for slot in schedule.get_assigned_games():
            event = self.convert_game_slot(slot)
            events.append(event)
        return events
    
    def convert_game_slot(self, slot: GameSlot) -> GameSimulationEvent:
        # Map TimeSlot enum to day of week
        game_dates = self.date_calculator.get_game_dates_for_week(slot.week)
        
        if 'TNF' in slot.time_slot.value:
            game_date = game_dates['thursday']
        elif 'MNF' in slot.time_slot.value:
            game_date = game_dates['monday']
        else:  # Sunday games
            game_date = game_dates['sunday']
        
        # Add time component based on slot
        if 'EARLY' in slot.time_slot.value:
            game_time = datetime.combine(game_date, time(13, 0))  # 1 PM
        elif 'LATE' in slot.time_slot.value:
            game_time = datetime.combine(game_date, time(16, 25))  # 4:25 PM
        elif 'NIGHT' in slot.time_slot.value:
            game_time = datetime.combine(game_date, time(20, 20))  # 8:20 PM
        else:
            game_time = datetime.combine(game_date, time(13, 0))  # Default
        
        return GameSimulationEvent(
            date=game_time,
            away_team_id=slot.away_team_id,
            home_team_id=slot.home_team_id,
            week=slot.week
        )
```

### 2.2 StoreManager Integration ✅ IMPLEMENTED

class SimpleStoreManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.game_results = {}
        self.player_stats = {}
        
    def process_game_result(self, game_id: str, result: Any):
        self.game_results[game_id] = result
        # Extract and store player stats
        
    def get_games_for_date(self, target_date: date) -> Dict:
        return {gid: res for gid, res in self.game_results.items() 
                if res.date.date() == target_date}
    
    def clear_date(self, target_date: date):
        # Remove games for this date after persistence
```

*Formerly Phase 2 - Now focuses on real components*

### 2.1 Create Roster Initializer
**File**: `src/utils/roster_initializer.py`

```python
from src.team_management.roster_generator import TeamRosterGenerator

class RosterInitializer:
    """Initialize all team rosters for the season"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.rosters = {}
        
    def initialize_all_rosters(self):
        """Generate rosters for all 32 teams"""
        print("Initializing team rosters...")
        for team_id in range(1, 33):
            roster = TeamRosterGenerator.generate_sample_roster(team_id)
            self.rosters[team_id] = roster
            print(f"  Team {team_id}: {len(roster)} players")
        print(f"✅ Initialized {len(self.rosters)} team rosters")
        return self.rosters
    
    def get_roster(self, team_id: int):
        return self.rosters.get(team_id, [])
```

**Test Script**: `test_roster_init.py`

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM games WHERE dynasty_id = 'xxx' AND week = 1;
   -- Returns actual game results
   ```

---

## Implementation Notes and Lessons Learned

### From Phase 1 Implementation:

1. **Import Path Complexity**: 
   - Relative imports cause issues beyond top-level package
   - Solution: Use try/except with fallback imports
   - Add sys.path manipulation when needed

2. **Database Initialization**:
   - Must call `DatabaseConnection.initialize_database()` before use
   - Tables don't exist until explicitly created
   - Solution: Add initialization check in SeasonInitializer

3. **Mock Components**:
   - Essential for incremental testing
   - Created `MockStoreManager` to avoid complex dependencies
   - Allows testing Phase 1 without Phase 2+ components

4. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Components should handle missing dependencies
   - Use `if ComponentClass is None:` checks
   - Provide mock/stub behavior for testing

### Common Issues and Solutions:

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Complex import paths | Use try/except with fallbacks |
| `no such table: dynasties` | DB not initialized | Run `initialize_database()` first |
| `attempted relative import` | Beyond top-level package | Convert to absolute imports |
| Missing components | Phased implementation | Use mock versions temporarily |
| Circular dependencies | Poor module structure | Refactor imports, use late imports |

## Next Steps After MVP

Once the MVP is working:

1. **Immediate Priority**:
   - Complete Phase 2 (Schedule → Event conversion)
   - Test with Week 1 games only
   - Verify database persistence

2. **Short Term** (After Phase 2):
   - Implement real StoreManager
   - Add full roster support
   - Test complete 18-week season

3. **Medium Term**:
   - Add playoff schedule generation
   - Implement standings calculation
   - Add season statistics

4. **Long Term**:
   - Web UI for viewing results
   - Multi-season dynasty mode
   - Advanced analytics

✅ **Event Scheduling**: 165/272 games scheduled in calendar (conflicts being resolved)
✅ **Day Simulation**: Games execute when simulated
✅ **Database Persistence**: Initial state and game results saved

### What Still Needs Work:
🔧 **Calendar Conflicts**: Only 165/272 games scheduled due to teams playing multiple games per week
🔧 **Conflict Resolution**: Need smarter assignment to prevent week-based conflicts
🔧 **Formal Converter**: Inline implementation needs extraction to class
🔧 **StoreManager**: Using mock, need real implementation
🔧 **Result Processing**: Disabled to avoid missing processors
⏳ **Roster Management**: Using mock rosters
⏳ **Standings/Stats**: Not yet implemented

✅ ~~Converts GameSlots to GameSimulationEvents~~ (Working inline)
✅ ~~Thursday games on Thursdays~~ (Working)
✅ ~~Sunday games on Sundays~~ (Working)
✅ ~~Monday games on Mondays~~ (Working)
✅ ~~Correct time components~~ (Working)
🔧 Extract to formal class
🔧 Support all 272 games

### For CalendarManager Integration:
✅ `schedule_event()` accepts GameSimulationEvents
✅ `get_events_for_date()` returns correct games
✅ `simulate_day()` executes scheduled games
✅ Results flow to StoreManager
✅ DailyDataPersister triggered after simulation

### For Database Persistence:
✅ Games table contains results after simulation
