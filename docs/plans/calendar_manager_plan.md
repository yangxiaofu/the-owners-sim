# Calendar Manager Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the development plan for implementing the Calendar Manager component based on the specification in `docs/specifications/calendar_manager.md`. The Calendar Manager will serve as the single source of truth for date/time state in the NFL simulation, providing date advancement capabilities and NFL season awareness.

### Key Goals
- **Single Responsibility**: Manage current date and advance time in simulation
- **NFL Season Awareness**: Track preseason, regular season, playoffs, and offseason
- **Event-Driven Integration**: Publish date changes for other systems to consume
- **High Performance**: < 1ms advancement for typical operations
- **Robust State Management**: Reliable persistence and recovery

### Timeline Overview
- **Phase 1.1 (Current)**: Core Foundation - Basic date management ❌ **NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION**
- **Phase 1.2 (Future)**: Season Structure - NFL season phases and logic
- **Phase 2 (Future)**: Advanced Features - Transitions, events, configuration
- **Phase 3 (Future)**: Integration & Persistence - System integration and state management
- **Phase 4 (Future)**: Optimization & Testing - Performance tuning and comprehensive testing

### Phase 1.1 Implementation Status ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Missing Components:**
- ❌ Core Date models and arithmetic (`src/calendar/date_models.py`) - **FILE MISSING**
- ❌ Exception hierarchy with user-friendly error handling (`src/calendar/calendar_exceptions.py`) - **FILE MISSING**
- ❌ Thread-safe CalendarComponent with validation (`src/calendar/calendar_component.py`) - **FILE MISSING**
- ❌ Public API and factory functions (`src/calendar/__init__.py`) - **FILE MISSING**
- ⚠️ Partial unit test suite (`tests/calendar/`) - **TEST FILES EXIST BUT NO IMPLEMENTATION**

**Current Status:**
- Implementation files are missing from `src/calendar/`
- Test files exist but cannot run without implementation
- Phase 1.1 needs to be implemented before proceeding to Phase 1.2
- Calendar directory exists but is empty (only `__pycache__`)

    to_phase: Optional[SeasonPhase]
    description: str

class TransitionType(Enum):
    SEASON_START = "season_start"
    SEASON_END = "season_end"
    PHASE_CHANGE = "phase_change"
    YEAR_END = "year_end"

                          structure: SeasonStructure) -> List[Transition]:
        # Analyze date range for phase changes
        # Return list of all transitions crossed

    def get_next_milestone(self, current_date: Date,
                          structure: SeasonStructure) -> DateMilestone:
        # Calculate next significant date/event
```

**Testing:**

    def publish_date_advanced(self, result: DateAdvanceResult):
        event = self.event_manager.create_event(
            name="DateAdvanced",
            event_date=result.end_date,
            metadata={
                "start_date": result.start_date,

                "transition_type": transition.type
            }
        )

# Event Types to Publish
EVENT_TYPES = [
    "DateAdvanced",      # Basic date advancement

- Dynasty-specific calendar isolation
- State validation and migration

**Implementation Details:**
```python
class CalendarPersistence:
    def __init__(self, database_api: DatabaseAPI):
        self.db = database_api

    def save_calendar_state(self, calendar: CalendarComponent, dynasty_id: str) -> bool:
        state = {
            "current_date": calendar.current_date,
            "season_structure": calendar.season_structure,
            "dynasty_id": dynasty_id,
            "last_updated": datetime.now()
        }
        return self.db.save_calendar_state(state)

    def load_calendar_state(self, dynasty_id: str) -> Optional[CalendarState]:
        # Load and validate saved state
        # Return None if no valid state found

    def validate_loaded_state(self, state: CalendarState) -> bool:
        # Ensure loaded state is valid and consistent
```

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE calendar_state (
    dynasty_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    current_date TEXT NOT NULL,
    season_structure TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Testing:**
- Save/load state accuracy
- Dynasty isolation verification
- State validation logic
- Migration handling

### 3.2 System Integration
**Integration Points:**

**With FullGameSimulator:**
```python
# Enhanced FullGameSimulator to accept date context
class FullGameSimulator:
    def simulate_game(self, game_date: Optional[Date] = None) -> GameResult:
        if game_date:
            # Use provided date for game context
            # Affects weather, player fatigue, etc.
        return self._run_simulation()
```

**With Season Manager:**
```python
# Coordinate calendar with season progression
class SeasonManager:
    def __init__(self, calendar: CalendarComponent):
        self.calendar = calendar

    def advance_to_next_game_day(self):
        # Use calendar to advance to next scheduled game
        next_game_date = self._get_next_game_date()
        days_to_advance = self._calculate_days_difference(next_game_date)
        result = self.calendar.advance(days_to_advance)

        # Handle any transitions that occurred
        for transition in result.transitions_crossed:
            self._handle_season_transition(transition)
```

**With Event System:**
```python
# Calendar events trigger other system responses
class GameScheduler:
    def __init__(self, calendar: CalendarComponent):
        calendar.subscribe_to_events([
            "DateAdvanced",
            "PhaseTransition",
            "SeasonStarted"
        ])

    def on_date_advanced(self, event: Event):
        # Check for scheduled games on new date
        # Trigger game simulations if needed

    def on_phase_transition(self, event: Event):
        # Handle season phase changes
        # Update schedules, trigger offseason activities
```

**Testing:**
- Calendar + FullGameSimulator integration
- Calendar + Season Manager coordination
- Event-driven system responses
- End-to-end date progression scenarios

### 3.3 Error Handling & Edge Cases
**File:** `src/calendar/calendar_exceptions.py`

**Exception Hierarchy:**
```python
class CalendarException(Exception):
    """Base calendar exception"""

class InvalidDaysException(CalendarException):
    """Raised when advancing by invalid number of days"""

    """Raised when advancing beyond season boundaries"""

class InvalidDateException(CalendarException):
    """Raised when date calculations result in invalid dates"""

class StateValidationException(CalendarException):
    """Raised when loaded state fails validation"""
```

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self._cache = CalendarCache()

    def get_current_phase(self) -> SeasonPhase:
        # Cache frequently accessed calculations
        if self._cache.is_valid("current_phase", self.current_date):
            return self._cache.get("current_phase")

        phase = self._calculate_current_phase()
        self._cache.set("current_phase", phase, self.current_date)
        return phase

class CalendarCache:
    def __init__(self, max_size: int = 100):
        self.cache = {}
        self.timestamps = {}
        self.max_size = max_size

    def is_valid(self, key: str, current_date: Date) -> bool:
        # Check if cached value is still valid for current date

    def get(self, key: str) -> Any:
        return self.cache.get(key)

    def set(self, key: str, value: Any, date: Date):
        # Store value with date-based invalidation
```

**Performance Targets:**
- `advance()`: < 1ms for typical calls (1-7 days)

```

**Testing:**

## Implementation Strategy

### Build Order
1. **Foundation First**: Start with basic Date object and simple advance() method
2. **Add NFL Awareness**: Implement season phases and NFL-specific logic
3. **Event Integration**: Connect to existing event infrastructure
4. **Persistence Layer**: Add state saving/loading capabilities
5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize based on real usage patterns
6. **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive system integration verification

### Integration Philosophy
- **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: Use `src/calendar/` components where possible
- **Coordinate with Season Manager**: High-level orchestration through season manager
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use events for loose coupling between systems
- **Dynasty Isolation**: Maintain separate calendar state per dynasty
