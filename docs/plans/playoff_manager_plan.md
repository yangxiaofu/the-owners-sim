# Playoff Manager Implementation Plan

**Version**: 2.0.0
**Status**: Phase 2 Complete (Playoff Manager & Playoff Scheduler Implemented)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-03

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for transitioning from regular season to playoffs in the NFL simulation MVP. The plan introduces three core components (`PlayoffSeeder`, `PlayoffManager`, and `PlayoffScheduler`) that integrate with the existing phase transition notification system to automatically seed teams and generate playoff brackets when the regular season completes.

### Current Status (2025-10-03)

**Phase 1: Playoff Seeder** - ✅ **COMPLETE**
- Fully implemented and tested playoff seeding calculation
- Flexible API supporting both live data and snapshots
- Real-time seeding for any week 10-18 (not just end of season)
- Rich data models with helper methods
- 12 comprehensive unit tests
- Interactive demo with realistic Week 10 and Week 18 scenarios
- **Time**: 6 hours

**Phase 2: Playoff Manager & Playoff Scheduler** - ✅ **COMPLETE**
- Pure bracket generation logic (PlayoffManager)
- Dynamic playoff progression with re-seeding
- GameEvent creation and scheduling (PlayoffScheduler)
- Progressive round scheduling (wild card → divisional → conference → super bowl)
- 27 comprehensive unit tests (17 manager + 10 scheduler)
- Interactive demo showing complete playoff flow
- **Time**: 8 hours

**Next Steps**: Phase 3 (Notification Integration), Phase 4 (Database API Extensions - Optional)

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What Already Exists

#### 1. Phase Detection Infrastructure (`src/calendar/`)

**Files**:
- `season_phase_tracker.py`: Automatic transition detection when 272 regular season games complete
- `phase_transition_triggers.py`: Contains `RegularSeasonToPlayoffsTrigger` class
- `calendar_notifications.py`: Observer pattern for phase transitions

**Key Components**:
```python
class SeasonPhaseTracker:
    # Tracks game completions and detects phase transitions
    def record_game_completion(game_event) -> Optional[PhaseTransition]

class RegularSeasonToPlayoffsTrigger(TransitionTrigger):
    TOTAL_REGULAR_SEASON_GAMES = 272  # 32 teams × 17 games ÷ 2
    # Triggers when all 272 regular season games complete
```

**How It Works**:
1. Each completed game recorded via `SeasonPhaseTracker.record_game_completion()`
2. When game 272 completes, `RegularSeasonToPlayoffsTrigger` activates
3. PhaseTransition event created with metadata:
   - `from_phase`: REGULAR_SEASON
   - `to_phase`: PLAYOFFS
   - `trigger_date`: Date of last regular season game
   - `trigger_event`: Game completion event

#### 2. Notification System (`src/calendar/`)

**Files**:
- `calendar_notifications.py`: Pub/sub notification system
- `notification_examples.py`: Example listener implementations

**Key Components**:
```python
class CalendarEventPublisher:
    def subscribe(callback, notification_types=None)
    def publish_phase_transition(transition: PhaseTransition)

class PhaseTransitionNotification:
    notification_type = NotificationType.PHASE_TRANSITION
    data = {
        'from_phase': 'regular_season',
        'to_phase': 'playoffs',
        'transition_type': 'PLAYOFFS_START',
        'trigger_date': Date(...),
        'metadata': {...}
    }
```

**Example Listener Pattern** (from `notification_examples.py:70`):
```python
def _handle_phase_transition(self, notification: CalendarNotification) -> None:
    data = notification.data
    if to_phase == "playoffs":
        print("  → Initializing playoff bracket")  # We need to implement this!
```

#### 3. Standings & Seeding Data (`src/stores/`, database)

**File**: `src/stores/standings_store.py`

**Key Method** (`line 359`):
```python
def get_playoff_picture(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get current playoff seedings."""
    # Returns structure:
    {
        'AFC': {
            '1_seed': EnhancedTeamStanding,  # Best division winner
            '2_seed': EnhancedTeamStanding,  # 2nd division winner
            '3_seed': EnhancedTeamStanding,  # 3rd division winner
            '4_seed': EnhancedTeamStanding,  # 4th division winner
            '5_seed': EnhancedTeamStanding,  # Best wildcard
            '6_seed': EnhancedTeamStanding,  # 2nd wildcard
            '7_seed': EnhancedTeamStanding   # 3rd wildcard
        },
        'NFC': { ... }  # Same structure
    }
```

**Current Logic**:
- Division winners (4 teams per conference) sorted by record
- Wildcards are next best 3 teams not already in as division winners
- Seeds 1-4: Division winners (best records get top seeds)
- Seeds 5-7: Wildcard teams (best records)

**Database Tables** (from `docs/schema/database_schema.md`):
```sql
-- Stores formal playoff seeding results
CREATE TABLE playoff_seedings (
    dynasty_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    season INTEGER NOT NULL,
    conference TEXT NOT NULL,     -- 'AFC' or 'NFC'
    seed_number INTEGER NOT NULL, -- 1-7
    team_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    wins, losses, ties, division_winner,
    tiebreaker_applied TEXT,      -- Description of tiebreaker used
    ...
);

-- Stores playoff bracket matchups and results
CREATE TABLE playoff_brackets (
    dynasty_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    season INTEGER NOT NULL,
    round_name TEXT NOT NULL,     -- 'wild_card', 'divisional', 'conference', 'super_bowl'
    game_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    conference TEXT,              -- 'AFC', 'NFC', or NULL for Super Bowl
    home_seed INTEGER,
    away_seed INTEGER,
    home_team_id INTEGER,
    away_team_id INTEGER,
    winner_team_id INTEGER,       -- NULL until game completed
    ...
);

-- Stores tiebreaker application history
CREATE TABLE tiebreaker_applications (
    dynasty_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    season INTEGER NOT NULL,
    tiebreaker_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'division', 'wildcard'
    rule_applied TEXT NOT NULL,     -- 'head_to_head', 'strength_of_victory', etc.
    teams_involved TEXT NOT NULL,   -- JSON array of team IDs
    winner_team_id INTEGER,
    calculation_details TEXT,       -- JSON with calculation breakdown
    ...
);
```

#### 4. API Integration Points

**File**: `src/season/season_manager.py`

**Stub Methods** (ready for implementation):
```python
# Line 278
def simulate_to_playoffs(self, dynasty_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Simulate the entire regular season up to playoffs."""
    # TODO: Implement simulate to playoffs
    # - Find end of regular season date
    # - Calculate playoff seeding
    # - Return season summary

# Line 315
def get_playoff_status(self, dynasty_id: str, season: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get playoff seeding and bracket status."""
    # TODO: Implement playoff status
    # - Check if regular season is complete
    # - Calculate playoff seeding
    # - Get playoff bracket status
```

**File**: `src/database/api.py`

**Ready for Extension**: DatabaseAPI is centralized and can easily add:
- `get_playoff_seeding(dynasty_id, season, conference)`
- `get_playoff_bracket(dynasty_id, season, round_name)`
- `persist_playoff_seeding(dynasty_id, season, seeding_data)`
- `persist_playoff_bracket(dynasty_id, season, bracket_data)`

---

### ✅ **NEW: What Has Been Implemented (Phase 1)**

#### Playoff Seeder Component (`src/playoff_system/`)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Files Implemented**:
- `src/playoff_system/seeding_models.py` - Data structures for playoff seeding
- `src/playoff_system/playoff_seeder.py` - Core seeding calculation logic
- `src/playoff_system/__init__.py` - Module exports
- `tests/playoff_system/test_playoff_seeder.py` - Comprehensive unit tests
- `demo/playoff_seeder_demo/playoff_seeder_demo.py` - Interactive demonstration

**Key Features**:
1. **Flexible Input API**: Accepts either `StandingsStore` instance or dictionary of `EnhancedTeamStanding`
   ```python
   seeder = PlayoffSeeder()
   # Option 1: Live store
   seeding = seeder.calculate_seeding(standings_store, season=2024, week=12)
   # Option 2: Snapshot dict
   seeding = seeder.calculate_seeding(standings_dict, season=2024, week=12)
   ```

2. **Real-Time Seeding**: Works for any week 10-18 (not just end of season)
   - Enables mid-season playoff picture tracking
   - Shows current standings as if season ended today

3. **Rich Data Models**:
   - `PlayoffSeed`: Individual team seed with full stats and metadata
   - `ConferenceSeeding`: 7 seeds per conference with clinch/elimination tracking
   - `PlayoffSeeding`: Complete seeding for both conferences with helper methods

4. **Helper Methods**:
   ```python
   seeding.is_in_playoffs(team_id)        # Check playoff status
   seeding.get_seed(team_id)              # Get team's seed
   seeding.get_matchups()                 # Wild card matchups
   seeding.to_dict()                      # Serialization
   ```

5. **MVP Sorting Logic**:
   - Primary: Win percentage
   - Secondary: Total wins
   - Tertiary: Point differential
   - Quaternary: Points scored
   - **Future**: Full NFL tiebreaker rules (Phase 1b)

6. **Comprehensive Demo**:
   - Week 10 scenario: Early playoff picture with 32 realistic team records
   - Week 18 scenario: Final seeding with wild card matchups
   - Colorful terminal output with team names
   - Successfully runs: `PYTHONPATH=src python3 demo/playoff_seeder_demo/playoff_seeder_demo.py`

7. **Unit Test Coverage**: 12 tests covering all core functionality

**Demo Output Example**:
```

```

**What's Still Missing for Seeder**:
- Full NFL tiebreaker implementation (Phase 1b - future enhancement)
- Persistence logic for playoff_seedings table (handled by PlayoffManager in Phase 2)

---

### ❌ What's Still Missing

1. **Playoff Manager Component**
   - No orchestrator for playoff bracket generation
   - No logic to create matchups from seeds (1 vs 7, 2 vs 6, etc.)
   - No playoff game scheduling system

3. **Notification Listener Implementation**
   - Example pattern exists, but no actual listener subscribed to phase transitions
   - No integration between notification system and playoff initialization

4. **Playoff Game Scheduling**
   - No system to create calendar events for playoff games
   - No wildcard/divisional/conference/super bowl game generation

5. **Database API Methods**
   - Methods for playoff data queries not yet implemented
   - Persistence methods for seeding/bracket data not yet implemented

---

## Architecture Assessment

### Proposed Approach: `PlayoffSeeder` + `PlayoffManager`

**Verdict**: ✅ **EXCELLENT APPROACH**

**Rationale**:
1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Seeder handles calculation logic (pure function)
   - Manager handles orchestration and side effects

2. **Follows Existing Patterns**:
   - Matches SeasonManager, DynastyManager, GameManager patterns
   - Consistent with project's Manager convention

3. **Clean Integration**:
   - Integrates naturally with notification system
   - Database tables already designed for this architecture

4. **Testability**:
   - Seeder can be unit tested in isolation
   - Manager can be tested with mocked dependencies

        Returns:
            PlayoffSeeding with complete seeding for both conferences
        """
```

**Data Models Implemented**:
```python
@dataclass
class PlayoffSeed:
    """Represents a single playoff seed (1-7)."""
    seed: int
    team_id: int
    wins: int
    losses: int
    ties: int
    win_percentage: float
    division_winner: bool
    division_name: str

    week: int
    afc: ConferenceSeeding
    nfc: ConferenceSeeding
    tiebreakers_applied: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    calculation_date: str
```

**Key Features Implemented**:
1. ✅ Flexible input (StandingsStore or dict)
2. ✅ Real-time seeding for weeks 10-18
3. ✅ MVP sorting (win %, wins, point diff, points for)
4. ✅ Helper methods (is_in_playoffs, get_seed, get_matchups)
5. ✅ Serialization (to_dict)
6. ✅ 12 comprehensive unit tests
7. ✅ Interactive demo with realistic scenarios

**Tiebreaker Implementation**:
- **MVP (Current)**: Simple sorting by win %, wins, point differential

**Demo Output**:
- Run: `PYTHONPATH=src python3 demo/playoff_seeder_demo/playoff_seeder_demo.py`
- Shows Week 10 and Week 18 scenarios
- Displays seeding with color-coded output
- Shows wild card matchups

### Phase 2: Playoff Manager & Playoff Scheduler ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

**Files Created**:
- `src/playoff_system/bracket_models.py` - Bracket data structures
- `src/playoff_system/playoff_manager.py` - Pure bracket generation logic
- `src/playoff_system/playoff_scheduler.py` - GameEvent creation and scheduling
- `tests/playoff_system/test_playoff_manager.py` - 17 comprehensive tests
- `tests/playoff_system/test_playoff_scheduler.py` - 10 comprehensive tests
- `demo/playoff_manager_demo/playoff_manager_demo.py` - Interactive demo

**Key Design Decision**: Split into two components for clean separation of concerns:
1. **PlayoffManager**: Pure logic (no side effects)
2. **PlayoffScheduler**: Side effects (GameEvent creation, storage)

#### PlayoffManager (Pure Logic)

**File**: `src/playoff_system/playoff_manager.py`

**Actual Implementation**:
```python
class PlayoffManager:
    """
    Pure playoff bracket generation and progression logic.
    Implements NFL playoff rules including re-seeding.
    NO side effects - pure functions only.
    """

    def generate_wild_card_bracket(
        self,
        seeding: PlayoffSeeding,
        start_date: Date,
        season: int
    ) -> PlayoffBracket:
        """Generate wild card round from seeding (6 games)."""
        # Creates (2v7, 3v6, 4v5) × 2 conferences
        # #1 seeds get bye week

    def generate_divisional_bracket(
        self,
        wild_card_results: List[GameResult],
        original_seeding: PlayoffSeeding,
        start_date: Date,
        season: int
    ) -> PlayoffBracket:
        """Generate divisional round with NFL re-seeding (4 games)."""
        # #1 seed plays LOWEST remaining seed
        # Other two winners play each other

    def generate_conference_championship_bracket(
        self,
        divisional_results: List[GameResult],
        start_date: Date,
        season: int
    ) -> PlayoffBracket:
        """Generate conference championships (2 games)."""

    def generate_super_bowl_bracket(
        self,
        conference_results: List[GameResult],
        start_date: Date,
        season: int
    ) -> PlayoffBracket:
        """Generate Super Bowl (1 game)."""
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Pure functions - no database access, no event creation
- ✅ Dynamic bracket progression (can't schedule all upfront)
- ✅ NFL re-seeding: #1 plays LOWEST remaining seed
- ✅ Home field advantage: Higher seed always hosts
- ✅ Game date calculations for each round

#### PlayoffScheduler (Side Effects)

**File**: `src/playoff_system/playoff_scheduler.py`

**Actual Implementation**:
```python
class PlayoffScheduler:
    """
    Creates GameEvent objects for playoff games dynamically.
    Handles progressive bracket scheduling as results come in.
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        event_db_api: EventDatabaseAPI,
        playoff_manager: PlayoffManager
    ):
        self.event_db_api = event_db_api
        self.playoff_manager = playoff_manager

    def schedule_wild_card_round(
        self,
        seeding: PlayoffSeeding,
        start_date: Date,
        season: int,
        dynasty_id: str
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Schedule wild card games (known immediately from seeding).
        Creates 6 GameEvent objects, stores in EventDatabaseAPI.
        """

    def schedule_next_round(
        self,
        completed_results: List[GameResult],
        current_round: str,  # 'wild_card', 'divisional', or 'conference'
        original_seeding: PlayoffSeeding,
        start_date: Date,
        season: int,
        dynasty_id: str
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Progressive scheduling: Schedule next round after current completes.

        Flow:
        - Wild card completes → Schedule divisional
        - Divisional completes → Schedule conference championships
        - Conference completes → Schedule Super Bowl
        """
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Creates GameEvent objects with `season_type="playoffs"`, `overtime_type="playoffs"`
- ✅ Progressive scheduling (can't schedule all rounds upfront)
- ✅ Uses PlayoffManager to determine matchups
- ✅ Stores events in EventDatabaseAPI
- ✅ Returns event IDs and bracket data

#### Bracket Data Models

**File**: `src/playoff_system/bracket_models.py`

```python
@dataclass
class PlayoffGame:
    """Single playoff game with complete context."""
    away_team_id: int
    home_team_id: int
    away_seed: int
    home_seed: int
    game_date: Date
    round_name: str  # 'wild_card', 'divisional', 'conference', 'super_bowl'
    conference: Optional[str]  # 'AFC', 'NFC', or None for Super Bowl
    game_number: int
    week: int
    season: int

@dataclass
class PlayoffBracket:
    """Collection of games for a specific round."""
    round_name: str
    season: int
    games: List[PlayoffGame]
    start_date: Date

    def validate(self) -> bool:
        """Validates bracket structure."""
```

**Test Coverage** (27 tests total):
1. **test_playoff_manager.py** (17 tests):
   - Wild card matchups (2v7, 3v6, 4v5)
   - Home field advantage
   - Divisional re-seeding (#1 vs lowest)
   - Conference and Super Bowl generation
   - Bracket validation
   - Error handling

2. **test_playoff_scheduler.py** (10 tests):
   - GameEvent creation
   - Progressive scheduling
   - Integration with PlayoffManager
   - Event storage
   - Unique game ID generation

### Phase 3: Notification Integration

**File**: `demo/interactive_season_sim/season_controller.py`

**Changes Required**:
```python
class SeasonController:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # ... existing initialization ...

        # NEW: Initialize playoff system components
        self.playoff_seeder = PlayoffSeeder(self.standings_store)
        self.playoff_manager = PlayoffManager(
            database_api=self.database_api,
            calendar_manager=self.calendar,
            playoff_seeder=self.playoff_seeder
        )

        # NEW: Subscribe to phase transition notifications
        if self.calendar._publisher:
            self.calendar._publisher.subscribe(
                self._handle_phase_transition,
                [NotificationType.PHASE_TRANSITION]
            )

    def _handle_phase_transition(
        self,
        notification: CalendarNotification
    ) -> None:
        """Handle phase transition notifications."""
        data = notification.data
        to_phase = data.get('to_phase')

        if to_phase == 'playoffs':
            print("\n🏈 REGULAR SEASON COMPLETE - INITIALIZING PLAYOFFS 🏈\n")

            # Initialize playoffs
            result = self.playoff_manager.initialize_playoffs(
                dynasty_id=self.dynasty_id,
                season=self.season_year,
                start_date=self.calendar.get_current_date()
            )

            if result['success']:
                print(f"✅ Playoffs initialized successfully!")
                print(f"   Games scheduled: {result['games_scheduled']}")
                print(f"   Wild Card starts: {result['wildcard_start_date']}")

                # Display seeding
                self._display_playoff_seeding(result['seeding'])
            else:
                print(f"❌ Failed to initialize playoffs: {result.get('error')}")

    def _display_playoff_seeding(self, seeding: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        """Display playoff seeding to user."""
        # Format and print AFC/NFC seeding
```

**Integration Points**:
1. Subscribe to `CalendarEventPublisher` during initialization
2. Listen for `PhaseTransitionNotification` with `to_phase='playoffs'`
3. Trigger `PlayoffManager.initialize_playoffs()` when notification received
4. Display seeding results to user
5. Continue normal simulation flow (playoff games execute like regular games)

### Phase 4: Database API Enhancements

**File**: `src/database/api.py`

**New Methods**:

2. **Notification → Listener**
   - **NEW**: Subscribe `SeasonController._handle_phase_transition()` to publisher
   - Implemented in Phase 3

3. **Listener → Playoff Manager**
   - **NEW**: Create `PlayoffManager` and trigger `initialize_playoffs()`
   - Implemented in Phase 2 & 3

4. **Playoff Manager → Seeder**
   - **NEW**: `PlayoffManager` calls `PlayoffSeeder` for calculation
   - Implemented in Phase 1 & 2

5. **Playoff Manager → Database**
   - **NEW**: Persist seeding and bracket via `DatabaseAPI`
   - Implemented in Phase 2 & 4

## Recommended First Steps

### MVP Implementation Order

1. ✅ **Create Directory Structure** (COMPLETE)
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/playoff_system tests/playoff_system demo/playoff_seeder_demo
   touch src/playoff_system/__init__.py
   touch tests/playoff_system/__init__.py
   touch demo/playoff_seeder_demo/__init__.py
   ```

2. ✅ **Implement PlayoffSeeder** (Phase 1 - COMPLETE)
   - ✅ Created `seeding_models.py` with PlayoffSeed, ConferenceSeeding, PlayoffSeeding
   - ✅ Implemented `playoff_seeder.py` with flexible input API
   - ✅ MVP sorting by win %, wins, point differential, points scored
   - ✅ Unit tests: 12 comprehensive tests covering all functionality
   - ✅ Demo: Interactive demo with Week 10 and Week 18 scenarios
   - ✅ Real-time seeding support (works for any week 10-18)
   - **Time Taken**: ~6 hours

3. ⏳ **Implement PlayoffManager** (Phase 2 - NEXT)
   - Initialize with dependencies (database, calendar, seeder)
   - Implement `initialize_playoffs()` orchestration
   - Implement `generate_bracket()` for wild card matchups
   - Implement basic `schedule_playoff_games()` (wild card only for MVP)
   - Unit test with mock dependencies

4. **Extend DatabaseAPI** (Phase 4)
   - Implement `persist_playoff_seeding()`
   - Implement `persist_playoff_bracket()`
   - Implement `get_playoff_seeding()`
   - Implement `get_playoff_bracket()`
   - Integration test with actual database

5. **Integrate Notification Listener** (Phase 3)
   - Subscribe to phase transition notifications in `SeasonController`
   - Implement `_handle_phase_transition()` callback
   - Trigger `PlayoffManager.initialize_playoffs()` on playoffs phase
   - Display seeding results to user

6. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Run interactive season sim through full regular season
   - Verify automatic playoff initialization after game 272
   - Verify seeding displayed correctly
   - Verify 6 wild card games scheduled in calendar
   - Verify database persistence

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. **Phase 1b: Full Tiebreaker Implementation**
   - Head-to-head record calculation
   - Division record comparison
   - Common games analysis
   - Strength of victory/schedule calculations
   - Persist tiebreaker details to `tiebreaker_applications` table

2. **Divisional/Conference/Super Bowl Scheduling**
   - Dynamic bracket updates after each round
   - Re-seeding logic (1 seed plays lowest remaining seed)
   - Super Bowl neutral site selection

3. **Playoff Game Result Handling**
   - Update `playoff_brackets` table with winners
   - Advance winners to next round
   - Schedule next round games dynamically

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Interactive bracket display in terminal
   - Real-time playoff standings updates
   - Playoff game highlights and summaries

---

## Technical Considerations

### Error Handling

**Critical Failure Points**:
1. Seeding calculation fails (missing standings data)
2. Database persistence fails (constraint violations)
3. Calendar event creation fails (date conflicts)
4. Notification subscriber fails (unhandled exceptions)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Validate standings data before seeding calculation
- Use database transactions for atomic persistence
- Implement rollback on failure
- Wrap notification handlers in try/except
- Return detailed error messages in result dictionaries

### Performance

**Bottlenecks**:
- Tiebreaker calculations (head-to-head requires game result queries)
- Database writes (14 seeding records + 13 bracket records)
- Calendar event generation (13 events)

**Optimizations**:
- Batch database inserts
- Cache standings calculations
- Lazy tiebreaker evaluation (only when needed)
- Async notification processing (future enhancement)

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**:
- `PlayoffSeeder.calculate_playoff_seeding()` with various standings scenarios
- `PlayoffSeeder.apply_tiebreakers()` with tied teams
- `PlayoffManager.generate_bracket()` with valid seeding
- `PlayoffManager.schedule_playoff_games()` with date calculations

**Integration Tests**:
- Full playoff initialization workflow
- Database persistence round-trip
- Calendar event creation and retrieval
- Notification pub/sub integration

**End-to-End Tests**:
- Simulate full regular season → automatic playoff transition
- Verify seeding accuracy with known standings
- Verify bracket matchups correct (2v7, 3v6, 4v5)
- Verify database state after initialization

---

## Open Questions for Discussion

1. **Tiebreaker Scope for MVP**
   - Should MVP include basic tiebreakers (head-to-head) or just win/loss?
   - Recommendation: Start with win/loss only, add tiebreakers in Phase 1b

2. **Playoff Game Execution**
   - Should playoff games use existing `FullGameSimulator` unchanged?
   - Do playoff games need special logic (no ties, overtime rules)?
   - Recommendation: Use existing simulator, add `PlayoffOvertimeManager` if needed

3. **Bracket Display**
   - Should interactive sim display bracket visually in terminal?
   - Should bracket be static at initialization or update after each game?
   - Recommendation: Display seeding list initially, defer visual bracket to post-MVP

4. **Wild Card Scheduling**
   - Should wild card games spread across Saturday/Sunday/Monday?
   - Should specific time slots be assigned?
   - Recommendation: Simplified scheduling (all games on single weekend) for MVP

5. **Dynamic vs Static Bracket**
   - Should divisional/conference games be pre-scheduled or created dynamically?
   - Recommendation: Pre-schedule wild card only, generate next round after results

### NFL Playoff Format

- **Teams**: 7 per conference (4 division winners + 3 wildcards)
- **Rounds**: Wild Card (6 games) → Divisional (4 games) → Conference (2 games) → Super Bowl (1 game)
- **Seeding**: Division winners ranked 1-4 by record, wildcards ranked 5-7
- **Matchups**:
  - Wild Card: (2)v(7), (3)v(6), (4)v(5), #1 seed bye
  - Divisional: #1 seed vs lowest remaining, other two seeds play
  - Conference: Winners of divisional games
  - Super Bowl: AFC Champion vs NFC Champion

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a clear path from the current state (automatic phase detection, notification infrastructure, and standings calculation) to the target state (complete playoff initialization with seeding and bracket generation). The proposed architecture (`PlayoffSeeder` + `PlayoffManager`) aligns perfectly with existing patterns and integrates cleanly with the notification system.

**Next Step**: Review plan and decide on tiebreaker scope for MVP (simple win/loss vs full NFL rules).
