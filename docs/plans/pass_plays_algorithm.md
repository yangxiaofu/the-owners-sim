# Pass Play Algorithm Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan implements a **Route Concept Matchup Matrix Algorithm** for calculating passing yards and outcomes in `pass_play.py`. The algorithm uses **situation-specific formulas** that match real NFL passing concepts, following KISS, SOLID, and YAGNI principles, consistent with our successful run play implementation.

## Current State Analysis

**Problems in Current Implementation:**
- Magic numbers scattered throughout (`0.15` sack chance, `0.02` INT rate, etc.)
- No route concept differentiation (all passes treated the same)
- Limited positional player utilization (RBs barely used, LBs not considered)
- No situational awareness (down/distance, field position effects)
- No coverage scheme modeling (zone vs man coverage)

## Three Algorithmic Approaches Considered

### **Approach 1: Route Concept Matchup Matrix** (Recommended)
*Similar to our successful run play algorithm*

**Core Concept:** Different route concepts have different effectiveness against various coverage schemes and defensive personnel.

**Route Concepts:**
- **Quick Game** (slants, hitches, bubble screens): Beat press/blitz, require accuracy + timing
- **Intermediate** (outs, ins, digs, comebacks): Beat zone coverage, require precision + route running  
- **Vertical** (go routes, posts, corners): Beat man coverage, require arm strength + speed
- **Screens** (RB/WR screens): Beat aggressive rush, require vision + blocking
- **Play Action** (deep shots off PA): Beat run-focused defense, require deception + arm strength

**Matchup Matrix Structure:**
```python
ROUTE_CONCEPT_MATRICES = {
    "quick_game": {
        "qb_attributes": ["accuracy", "release_time"],
        "wr_attributes": ["route_running", "hands"], 
        "base_completion": 0.75,
        "base_yards": 5.5,
        "vs_man_modifier": 1.2,    # Good vs man coverage
        "vs_zone_modifier": 0.9,   # Harder vs zone
        "vs_blitz_modifier": 1.4   # Excellent vs blitz
    }
}
```

### **Approach 2: Multi-Stage Process Simulation** 
*Step-by-step simulation of passing play development*

**Four Stages:**
1. **Protection Phase** (OL + RB vs DL + LB rush): Determines time to throw and pressure level
2. **Route Phase** (WR route running vs DB coverage): Calculates separation and target window size
3. **Throw Phase** (QB accuracy vs target difficulty): Pressure affects accuracy, separation affects difficulty
4. **After Catch Phase** (WR speed/YAC vs LB/S pursuit): Determines final yardage

**Advantages:** Most realistic to actual football, rich analytics data
**Disadvantages:** More complex to implement and balance

### **Approach 3: Dynamic Probability Tree**
*Weighted decision tree with situational modifiers*

**Decision Tree Flow:**
```
Pass Attempt
├── Sack (OL vs DL/LB) - 6-8%
├── Pressure → Affects all other outcomes
├── Quick Throw → Higher completion, lower yards
├── Normal Throw → Standard rates
└── Deep Throw → Lower completion, higher yards
```

## **Recommended Implementation: Route Concept Matchup Matrix**

### **Why This Approach:**
1. **Proven Success**: Similar structure to our working run algorithm
2. **Football Authenticity**: Based on real NFL route concepts and coverage schemes  
3. **Testable**: Clear metrics that map to NFL statistics
4. **Maintainable**: Centralized configuration for easy balance tuning

## Files to be Modified

### **Primary Changes**

#### 1. `/src/game_engine/plays/pass_play.py`
**Modifications:**
- Replace `_simulate_personnel_pass()` method with new matchup matrix logic
- Add 5 new helper methods:
  - `_determine_route_concept()`
  - `_determine_defensive_coverage()`
  - `_calculate_qb_effectiveness_for_route_concept()`
  - `_calculate_wr_effectiveness_for_route_concept()`
  - `_calculate_yards_from_route_matchup_matrix()`
  - `_apply_pass_situational_modifiers()`
- Add `ROUTE_CONCEPT_MATRICES` constant (configuration data)
- Add `PassGameBalance` centralized configuration class

**Lines affected:** ~120 lines (current method ~85 lines, replacement ~140 lines)

### **Testing Files**

#### 2. `/test_pass_algorithm.py` (new file)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive testing of the new algorithm
- Unit tests for each route concept
- QB/WR attribute effectiveness tests
- Coverage scheme validation
- Statistical distribution validation against NFL benchmarks

## Implementation Details

### **1. Route Concept Classification (KISS)**
```python
def _determine_route_concept(self, formation: str, field_state: FieldState, down_distance: tuple) -> str:
    """Simple classification based on formation and situation"""
    
    # Goal line situations
    if field_state.is_goal_line():
        return "quick_game"
    
    # Down and distance logic
    if down_distance[0] == 3 and down_distance[1] > 7:  # 3rd and long
        return "vertical"
    elif down_distance[0] == 3 and down_distance[1] <= 3:  # 3rd and short
        return "quick_game"
    
    # Formation-based classification
    formation_to_route_concept = {
        "shotgun": "quick_game",
        "shotgun_spread": "vertical", 
        "I_formation": "play_action",
        "singleback": "intermediate",
        "pistol": "intermediate"
    }
    
    return formation_to_route_concept.get(formation, "intermediate")  # Safe default
```

### **2. Coverage Recognition (SOLID: Single Responsibility)**
```python
def _determine_defensive_coverage(self, defensive_call: str, personnel) -> str:
    """Determine coverage type based on defensive call and personnel"""
    
    # Coverage mapping based on defensive call
    coverage_mapping = {
        "man_coverage": "man",
        "zone_coverage": "zone", 
        "blitz": "blitz",
        "prevent": "prevent",
        "nickel_pass": "zone",
        "dime_pass": "man"
    }
    
    return coverage_mapping.get(defensive_call, "zone")  # Safe default
```

### **3. Route Concept Matrices (KISS Configuration)**
```python
ROUTE_CONCEPT_MATRICES = {
    "quick_game": {
        "qb_attributes": ["accuracy", "release_time"],
        "wr_attributes": ["route_running", "hands"],

        "vs_prevent_modifier": 0.8,
        "variance": 1.1
    }
}
```

### **4. Player Effectiveness Calculators (SOLID: Single Responsibility)**
```python
def _calculate_qb_effectiveness_for_route_concept(self, qb, route_concept: str) -> float:
    """Calculate QB effectiveness for specific route concept"""
    
    if not qb:
        return 0.5  # Default
    
    matrix = ROUTE_CONCEPT_MATRICES[route_concept]
    total_rating = 0
    
    for attribute in matrix["qb_attributes"]:
        rating = getattr(qb, attribute, 50)  # Safe attribute access
        total_rating += rating
    
    avg_rating = total_rating / len(matrix["qb_attributes"])
    return avg_rating / 100  # Normalize to 0-1

def _calculate_wr_effectiveness_for_route_concept(self, wr, route_concept: str) -> float:
    """Calculate WR effectiveness for specific route concept"""
    
    if not wr:
        return 0.5  # Default
    
    matrix = ROUTE_CONCEPT_MATRICES[route_concept]
    total_rating = 0
    
    for attribute in matrix["wr_attributes"]:
        rating = getattr(wr, attribute, 50)  # Safe attribute access
        total_rating += rating
    
    avg_rating = total_rating / len(matrix["wr_attributes"])
    return avg_rating / 100  # Normalize to 0-1
```

### **5. Main Yards Calculation (KISS Logic Flow)**
```python
def _calculate_yards_from_route_matchup_matrix(self, offense_ratings, defense_ratings, 
                                              personnel, formation_modifier, field_state):
    """Main calculation method using route concept matchup matrix"""
    
    # Step 1: Determine route concept and coverage
    route_concept = self._determine_route_concept(personnel.formation, field_state)
    coverage_type = self._determine_defensive_coverage(personnel.defensive_call, personnel)
    matrix = ROUTE_CONCEPT_MATRICES[route_concept]
    
    # Step 2: Calculate QB effectiveness
    qb_effectiveness = self._calculate_qb_effectiveness_for_route_concept(
        personnel.qb_on_field, route_concept
    )
    
    # Step 3: Calculate WR effectiveness  
    wr_effectiveness = self._calculate_wr_effectiveness_for_route_concept(
        personnel.primary_wr, route_concept
    )
    
    # Step 4: Calculate protection effectiveness
    ol_rating = offense_ratings.get('ol', 50)
    dl_rating = defense_ratings.get('dl', 50)
    rb_protection = getattr(personnel.rb_on_field, 'pass_protection', 50) if personnel.rb_on_field else 50
    
    protection_effectiveness = (ol_rating + rb_protection * 0.3) / (dl_rating * 1.2)
    
    # Step 5: Calculate coverage effectiveness (DB vs route concept)
    db_rating = defense_ratings.get('db', 50)
    coverage_modifier = matrix[f"vs_{coverage_type}_modifier"]
    coverage_effectiveness = db_rating * coverage_modifier / 100
    
    # Step 6: Combine all factors
    completion_probability = (
        qb_effectiveness * PassGameBalance.QB_EFFECTIVENESS_WEIGHT +
        wr_effectiveness * PassGameBalance.WR_EFFECTIVENESS_WEIGHT +
        protection_effectiveness * PassGameBalance.PROTECTION_WEIGHT -
        coverage_effectiveness * PassGameBalance.COVERAGE_WEIGHT
    ) * formation_modifier
    
    # Step 7: Apply base completion rate and variance
    final_completion = matrix["base_completion"] * completion_probability
    
    # Step 8: Determine outcome
    return self._determine_pass_outcome(final_completion, matrix, route_concept, protection_effectiveness)
```
