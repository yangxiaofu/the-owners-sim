⏺ 🔍 Ultra Think Analysis: High Score & One-Team-Only Scoring Diagnosis

  Based on my comprehensive review of the test file patterns, I've identified 5 critical systemic issues causing the 288-0 unrealistic scoring:

  🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE #1: Post-Score Reset Failure

  Pattern: After every 🔧 SCORE APPLIED, the next play shows:
  - field_pos = 100 (still at goal line!)
  - post-score reset needed = True but reset doesn't execute properly
  - Teams stay in scoring position after touchdowns instead of kickoff

  Impact: Teams never have to drive down the field - they're always in scoring position

  🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE #2: Possession Change Broken

  Pattern:
  - possession_team_id: '5' dominates ~90% of plays
  - Even after possession_change_reason: TOUCHDOWN_SCORED, possession stays with team '5'
  - receiving_team = 1 indicates kickoffs should change possession, but it never happens

  Impact: Same team keeps getting the ball repeatedly

  🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE #3: Team ID Mapping Asymmetry

  Pattern:
  - possession_team_id: '5' → scoring_team: 1 (HOME team) ✅ Scores frequently
  - possession_team_id: '6' → scoring_team: None ❌ Never scores
  - All scores show scoring_team: 1 (HOME only)

  Impact: Away team physically cannot score due to broken team resolution

  🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE #4: Field Position Calculation Broken

  Pattern:
  - Constant field_pos = 100 (goal line) entries
  - No realistic field progression between plays
  - kickoff_reset created with new_field_position = X but field stays at 100

  Impact: No realistic game flow, always in red zone

  🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE #5: State Transition Pipeline Failure

  Pattern:
  - possession_change_reason: TOUCHDOWN_SCORED is detected correctly
  - But actual possession/field state never changes
  - Multiple touchdowns in rapid succession (6 points each = 48+ touchdowns!)

  Impact: Game becomes a scoring simulator instead of realistic football

  🎯 Root Cause Chain Reaction:

  1. Team '5' gets ball → Starts at field_pos=100 (bug)
  2. Scores touchdown → Should trigger possession change & field reset
  3. Reset fails → field_pos stays 100, possession stays '5'
  4. Cycle repeats → Same team, same field position, immediate scoring
  5. Result: 48+ touchdowns for HOME team, 0 for AWAY team

  🔍 Key Areas Needing Investigation:

  1. Post-score reset logic in Calculator/Applicator components
  2. Possession change application after scoring plays
  3. Team ID resolution for team '6' → scoring_team mapping
  4. Field position calculation after kickoffs/resets
  5. State transition validation - are transitions being applied?

  The 288-0 score suggests ~48 touchdowns occurred, which means the reset failure happened consistently throughout the entire game, creating an endless scoring loop for one team while completely
  preventing the other team from ever getting meaningful possession or scoring opportunities.
