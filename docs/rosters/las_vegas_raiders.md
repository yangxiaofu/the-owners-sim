- **Coaching Upgrade**: Pete Carroll brings championship pedigree and defensive expertise

### Areas of Focus
- **Quarterback Consistency**: Need to establish clear starter between Smith and Pickett

- **Wide Receiver Development**: Young receiving corps needs consistent production
- **Secondary Depth**: Cornerback group lacks elite top-end talent
- **Defensive Line Depth**: Need more production behind Crosby

### Coaching Philosophy
Pete Carroll emphasizes defensive fundamentals, competitive excellence, and player development. Chip Kelly's offensive system focuses on tempo, misdirection, and maximizing player strengths. Expect emphasis on fundamentals and building winning culture.
