# Play Engine Architecture

## Overview

The play engine is the core simulation component that takes two teams as input and produces a play result as output.

## Interface

```python
play_result = play_engine.simulate(team1, team2)
```

## Inputs

- `team1`: First team data structure
- `team2`: Second team data structure

## Output

- `playResult`: Result of the simulated play

## Implementation

The `play_engine.simulate()` method will initially do nothing (no-op) and return a basic playResult structure.
