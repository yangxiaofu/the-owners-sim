# Simulation System Summary

## Overview

The Simulation System provides a comprehensive framework for day-by-day NFL season simulation, managing various event types (games, training, scouting, rest days) through a unified calendar-based architecture. This system enables realistic season progression with polymorphic event handling and sophisticated result processing.

## Core Components

### 1. Calendar Manager (`src/simulation/calendar_manager.py`)

The heart of the simulation system, orchestrating all events throughout the season.

**Key Features:**
- Day-by-day simulation progression
- Event scheduling with conflict detection
- Team availability tracking
- Bye week management
- Multi-event parallel execution

**Core Classes:**
- `CalendarManager`: Main orchestration class
- `DaySimulationResult`: Daily simulation outcomes
- `ConflictResolution`: Strategies for handling scheduling conflicts

**Usage Example:**
```python
from simulation.calendar_manager import CalendarManager
from datetime import date

# Initialize calendar
calendar = CalendarManager(date(2024, 9, 1))

# Schedule events
success, message = calendar.schedule_event(game_event)

# Simulate a specific day
day_result = calendar.simulate_day(date(2024, 9, 8))

# Advance through multiple days
results = calendar.advance_to_date(date(2024, 12, 31))
```

### 2. Event System (`src/simulation/events/`)

Polymorphic event system supporting different activity types.

#### Base Event Structure
- `BaseSimulationEvent`: Abstract base class for all events

### 4. Season State Manager (`src/simulation/season_state_manager.py`)

Maintains comprehensive season-wide state and statistics.

**Tracked Information:**
- Team records (W-L-T)
- Division standings
- Playoff positioning
- Player statistics
- Injury reports
- Draft order
- Trade deadlines

**Key Methods:**
```python
# Update after game
state_manager.update_game_result(home_team, away_team, score)

# Check playoff eligibility
is_eligible = state_manager.is_playoff_eligible(team_id)

# Get current standings
standings = state_manager.get_division_standings(division)
```

## Event Lifecycle

### 1. Event Creation
```python
event = GameSimulationEvent(
    date=datetime(2024, 9, 8, 13, 0),
    away_team_id=22,
    home_team_id=23,
    week=1
)
```

### 2. Scheduling
```python
success, message = calendar.schedule_event(event)
```

### 3. Validation
- Check for conflicts
- Verify team availability
- Validate preconditions

### 4. Execution
```python
result = event.simulate()
```

### 5. Processing
```python
processor = GameResultProcessor()
processing_result = processor.process(result, context)
```

### 6. State Update
```python
state_manager.apply_result(processing_result)
```

## Integration with Schedule Generator

The simulation system seamlessly integrates with the NFL Schedule Generator:

### Loading Generated Schedules
```python
from scheduling.loaders.calendar_adapter import ScheduleCalendarAdapter
from scheduling.data.schedule_models import SeasonSchedule

# Load schedule into calendar
adapter = ScheduleCalendarAdapter(calendar)
load_result = adapter.load_schedule(season_schedule)
```

### Converting Schedule Events
```python
# ScheduledGame â†’ GameSimulationEvent
calendar_event = scheduled_game.to_calendar_event()
```

## Day-by-Day Simulation Flow

### Daily Execution
```python
# For each day in the season
for current_date in season_dates:
    # Get scheduled events
    events = calendar.get_events_for_date(current_date)
    
    # Execute each event
    for event in events:
        result = event.simulate()
        
        # Process result
        processor = get_processor_for_event(event)
        processing_result = processor.process(result)
        
        # Update state
        state_manager.update(processing_result)
    
    # Generate daily summary
    day_summary = calendar.get_day_summary(current_date)
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Parallel Event Execution
Multiple events on the same day execute in parallel for performance:
```python
# Training for multiple teams happens simultaneously
results = calendar.execute_parallel_events(daily_events)
```

### 2. Conflict Resolution Strategies
- **REJECT**: Deny conflicting events
- **RESCHEDULE**: Find alternative dates
- **FORCE**: Allow conflicts (testing only)

### 3. Event Priorities
Events have inherent priorities:
1. Games (highest)
2. Training
3. Scouting
4. Rest
5. Administrative (lowest)

### 4. Dynamic Event Generation
Create events based on simulation state:
```python
# Generate rest day after tough game
if game_result.was_overtime:
    rest_event = RestDayEvent(
        date=next_day,
        team_id=team_id,
        rest_type="recovery_day"
    )
    calendar.schedule_event(rest_event)
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Efficient**: Events loaded on-demand
- **Scalable**: Handles full season (500+ events)
- **Fast Lookups**: O(1) date-based event retrieval
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-event execution
- **Caching**: Result caching for repeated queries

## Testing Coverage

## Example: Full Season Simulation

```python
from simulation.calendar_manager import CalendarManager
from scheduling.loaders.calendar_adapter import ScheduleCalendarAdapter
from datetime import date

# Initialize system
start_date = date(2024, 9, 1)
calendar = CalendarManager(start_date)

# Load NFL schedule
adapter = ScheduleCalendarAdapter(calendar)
adapter.load_from_json_file("schedules/2024_nfl.json")

# Add training events
for team_id in range(1, 33):
    for week in range(1, 19):
        # Add weekly training
        training = TrainingEvent(
            date=get_training_date(week),
            team_id=team_id,
            training_type="practice"
        )
        calendar.schedule_event(training)

# Run full season
season_end = date(2025, 1, 5)
daily_results = calendar.advance_to_date(season_end)

# Generate season summary
print(f"Season complete: {len(daily_results)} days simulated")
for result in daily_results:
    if result.events_executed > 0:
        print(f"{result.date}: {result.events_executed} events")
```

The simulation system provides the foundation for realistic, comprehensive NFL season simulation with unlimited expansion possibilities.
