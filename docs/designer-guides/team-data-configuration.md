## Example: Creating an Aggressive Team

Let's transform the Chicago Bears into an aggressive, high-risk team:

```json
"1": {
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Bears",
  "city": "Chicago", 
  "ratings": {
    "offense": {
      "qb_rating": 75,        ‚Üê Increase QB for aggressive passing

      "defensive": 80,
      "offensive_coordinator": {
        "archetype": "air_raid",           ‚Üê Change to aggressive passing
        "personality": "aggressive",        ‚Üê Aggressive play calling
        "custom_modifiers": {
          "deep_passing_bonus": 0.10,      ‚Üê Bonus to deep throws

        "archetype": "aggressive_blitz",   ‚Üê Change to blitz-heavy
        "personality": "aggressive",        ‚Üê Aggressive approach
        "custom_modifiers": {

```

## Best Practices

### ‚öñÔ∏è Balance Considerations
- Keep overall team ratings realistic (40-95 range)
- Balance strengths and weaknesses for realistic teams
- Custom modifiers should typically be 0.05-0.15 (5%-15%)
- Match archetypes with team personnel ratings

### üß™ Testing Changes
1. Make small changes first (¬±5 rating points)
2. Test in single games before major modifications  
3. Keep backups of working configurations
4. Document changes for tracking balance evolution

### üìã Common Mistakes
- **Too many high ratings**: Creates unrealistic super-teams
- **Conflicting archetypes**: Run-heavy offense with low RB rating
- **Extreme modifiers**: Values above 0.20 can break game balance
- **Mismatched philosophy**: Conservative team with aggressive coordinators

## Troubleshooting

### Game Won't Start
- Check JSON syntax (commas, brackets, quotes)
- Verify all required fields are present
- Use a JSON validator tool online

### Unrealistic Results  
- Review custom modifier values (keep under 0.15)
- Check that archetypes match team strengths
- Ensure overall ratings are balanced

### Changes Not Applied
- Restart the game simulation completely
- Verify file was saved properly
- Check file location: `src/game_engine/data/sample_data/teams.json`

## Quick Reference

### Rating Scale
- **90-100**: Elite, best in league
- **80-89**: Very good, above average  
- **70-79**: Good, average starter quality
- **60-69**: Below average, backup quality
- **50-59**: Poor, significant weakness
- **Below 50**: Terrible, major liability

### Modifier Scale
- **0.05**: Small bonus (5%)
- **0.08**: Moderate bonus (8%) 
- **0.10**: Significant bonus (10%)
- **0.12**: Large bonus (12%)
- **0.15**: Major bonus (15%)
- **Above 0.15**: Use sparingly, can break balance
