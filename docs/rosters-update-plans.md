# NFL Roster Update Plans

This document outlines the comprehensive plan and methodology for updating NFL team rosters in "The Owners Sim" project, documenting the research process, file structure standards, and implementation guidelines.

## Project Overview

### Purpose
Create detailed roster documentation for all 32 NFL teams in the simulation, providing comprehensive player data that integrates seamlessly with the game's player management and simulation systems.

### Scope
- **Documentation**: Detailed markdown files for each team's 53-man roster
- **Data Integration**: Player entries in the central `players.json` database
- **Standardization**: Consistent format and attribute systems across all teams
- **Maintenance**: Guidelines for keeping rosters current with real NFL changes

### Current Status
- âœ… **Cleveland Browns** (Team ID: 7) - Complete roster documentation and player data
- âœ… **Buffalo Bills** (Team ID: 1) - Complete roster documentation and player data
- âœ… **Miami Dolphins** (Team ID: 2) - Complete roster documentation and player data
- ðŸ”„ **Remaining Teams**: 29 teams pending implementation

## Research Methodology

### Data Sources
Primary sources for roster information include:
1. **Official Team Websites** - Most current roster information
2. **NFL.com** - Official league roster data and statistics
3. **ESPN** - Comprehensive player statistics and injury reports
4. **Pro Football Reference** - Historical performance data and advanced metrics
5. **Sports Illustrated** - Depth chart analysis and roster breakdowns

### Information Gathering Process
1. **Current Roster Validation** - Verify 53-man roster composition
2. **Player Details Collection** - Names, jersey numbers, positions, college background
3. **Performance Analysis** - 2024 season statistics and performance metrics
4. **Experience Assessment** - Years in NFL, team tenure, leadership roles
5. **Attribute Estimation** - Based on performance data and positional requirements

### Quality Assurance
- Cross-reference multiple sources for accuracy
- Validate jersey numbers and position assignments
- Ensure roster composition matches NFL standards (position limits, total players)
- Verify no duplicate player entries within team

3. **Cross-Reference Information** across multiple sources
4. **Create Roster Documentation** following template structure
5. **Review and Validate** completeness and accuracy

#### Phase 2: Player Database Integration
1. **Determine Next Player ID** from current highest ID
2. **Create Player Entries** for all 53 players
3. **Assign Appropriate Attributes** based on performance and position
4. **Validate JSON Structure** and syntax
5. **Update Metadata** (total_players count, team inclusion)

#### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
1. **Test Player Loading** in simulation system
2. **Verify Team ID Mapping** and player associations
3. **Cross-Check Roster Completeness** (all positions covered)
4. **Review Attribute Consistency** across similar players
5. **Document Any Special Considerations** or known issues

### Batch Processing Strategy
