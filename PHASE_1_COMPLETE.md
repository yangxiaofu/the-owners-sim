# Phase 1 Complete: UI Foundation ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Complete
**Next Phase**: Phase 2 - Core Views (Season & Team)

## What Was Built

### 1. Project Structure
Created complete `ui/` folder hierarchy:
```
ui/
├── __init__.py
├── main_window.py
├── views/          (6 view files)
├── widgets/        (ready for Phase 3)
├── dialogs/        (ready for Phase 4)
├── models/         (ready for Phase 3)
├── controllers/    (ready for Phase 2)
├── resources/
│   └── styles/
│       └── main.qss
└── utils/          (ready for Phase 3)
```

### 2. Application Entry Point
- **`main.py`**: Qt application initialization with high DPI support
- **`requirements-ui.txt`**: PySide6 and UI dependencies
- **`test_ui.py`**: Import verification script

### 3. Main Window (`ui/main_window.py`)
✅ **Tab-based navigation** (6 primary tabs)
- Season, Team, Player, Offseason, League, Game

✅ **Complete menu bar**
- Game, Season, Team, Player, League, Tools, Help menus
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Q, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+W)
- Placeholder actions with informative dialogs

✅ **Toolbar**
- Quick actions (Sim Day, Sim Week, My Team, Standings, League)
- Icon placeholders ready for Phase 5

✅ **Status bar**
- Current date display
- Current phase display

### 4. View Stubs (All 6 Views)
Created placeholder views with descriptions of upcoming features:
- **season_view.py** → Schedule, standings, stats (Phase 2)
- **team_view.py** → Roster, depth chart, finances (Phase 2)
- **player_view.py** → Player details and stats (Phase 3)
- **offseason_view.py** → Offseason dashboard (Phase 4)
- **league_view.py** → League-wide stats (Phase 3)
- **game_view.py** → Live game simulation (Phase 2)

### 5. Styling
✅ **OOTP-inspired QSS stylesheet** (`main.qss`)
- Professional blue theme (#0066cc)
- Tab styling with hover effects
- Data table styles (zebra striping, sortable headers)
- Menu/toolbar theming
- Button and input styling
- Scroll bar customization

### 6. Documentation
- **`ui/README.md`**: Complete UI documentation
- **`docs/plans/ui_development_plan.md`**: Full 6-phase implementation plan

## Success Criteria Met ✅

✅ Application launches without errors
✅ All 6 tabs are clickable and functional
✅ Menu bar displays all menus with proper structure
✅ Toolbar is visible with placeholder buttons
✅ Status bar shows date and phase
✅ Window is properly sized (1600x1000) and resizable
✅ All imports work correctly (`python test_ui.py` passes)
✅ Professional OOTP-style appearance

## How to Run

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements-ui.txt
```

### Launch Application
```bash
python main.py
```

### Test Imports
```bash
python test_ui.py
```

## What Works Now

1. **Tab Navigation**: Click between all 6 tabs
2. **Menus**: All menu items display informative dialogs
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+Q (Exit), Ctrl+D (Sim Day), Ctrl+W (Sim Week)
4. **Toolbar**: Click any button for placeholder functionality
5. **About Dialog**: Help → About shows application info
6. **Window Management**: Resize, minimize, maximize
7. **Professional Theme**: OOTP-inspired styling throughout

## What's Coming Next (Phase 2)

### Season View
- Interactive schedule grid from database
- Week selector dropdown
- Actual simulation controls (integrate with SeasonCycleController)
- Real standings table
- Game result display

### Team View
- Roster table with real player data
- Team selector (32 NFL teams)
- Position filtering
- Player search
- Salary cap display from database

### Game View
- Live play-by-play from simulation
- Real-time scoreboard updates
- Drive summary
- Player statistics

**Estimated Timeline**: 2 weeks (Weeks 3-4)

## Technical Architecture

### Clean Separation
```
ui/             → User interface (PySide6/Qt)
    ↕ (controllers)
src/            → Simulation engine (no UI dependencies)
```

### Integration Pattern
```python
# UI Controller mediates between view and engine
class SeasonController:
    def __init__(self, db_path, dynasty_id):
        from src.season.season_cycle_controller import SeasonCycleController
        self.sim = SeasonCycleController(db_path, dynasty_id)

    def simulate_day(self):
        result = self.sim.advance_day()
        return result  # UI displays
```

## Files Created (Total: 19)

**Core Files:**
1. `main.py` - Application entry point
2. `requirements-ui.txt` - Dependencies
3. `test_ui.py` - Import test script
4. `PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md` - This summary

**UI Package:**
5. `ui/__init__.py`
6. `ui/main_window.py`
7-12. `ui/views/*.py` (6 view files)
13-18. `ui/*/__init__.py` (6 package __init__ files)
19. `ui/resources/styles/main.qss`
20. `ui/README.md`

## Notes

- All placeholder dialogs inform users what's coming in which phase
- Main window is fully functional but views show placeholders
- Stylesheet provides professional desktop feel
- Ready to integrate with existing simulation engine in Phase 2
- Dynasty isolation support built into architecture

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Install PySide6: `pip install -r requirements-ui.txt`
2. ✅ Run application: `python main.py`
3. ✅ Verify all tabs work
4. ⏳ Begin Phase 2: Implement Season and Team views with real data

**Phase 1 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

Ready to proceed to Phase 2! 🚀
