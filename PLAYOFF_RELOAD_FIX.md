# Playoff Reload Fix - Phase Synchronization

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Issue**: Games re-scheduling when reloading dynasty mid-playoffs
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Problem Summary

When reloading the application mid-playoffs, playoff games were being re-scheduled even though they already existed in the database, creating duplicate game events.

### Symptom

- Test `demo/playoff_tester_demo/playoff_duplication_test.py` **passed** ✅
- But UI still duplicated games when reloading saved dynasty mid-playoffs ❌

## Root Cause

The test passed because it simulated a clean scenario where `PlayoffController` was initialized twice with the same database, and the duplicate detection worked correctly.

However, the UI failed due to a **phase synchronization bug** in the initialization flow:

### Execution Flow (Before Fix)

```
1. User closes app mid-playoffs
2. User reopens app → main.py → MainWindow → SimulationController
3. SimulationController.__init__():
   → _load_state() loads phase="PLAYOFFS" from database ✅
   → BUT caches it locally, doesn't update SeasonCycleController
4. _init_season_controller() creates SeasonCycleController:
   → __init__() sets phase_state = REGULAR_SEASON (WRONG!) ❌
   → SimulationController never updates this phase_state
5. User simulates a day/week:
   → SeasonCycleController.advance_day() → _check_phase_transition()
   → Sees phase == REGULAR_SEASON (wrong!)
   → Checks _is_regular_season_complete() → True
   → Calls _transition_to_playoffs() AGAIN ❌
6. NEW PlayoffController created → tries to schedule 6 games AGAIN
7. My original fix detects existing games and skips them
8. But the redundant initialization still occurs
```

### Key Evidence

**File: `ui/controllers/simulation_controller.py`**
```python
def _load_state(self):
    state_info = self.state_model.initialize_state()
    self.current_date_str = state_info['current_date']
    self.current_week = state_info['current_week']
    # ❌ Phase loaded but NEVER applied to SeasonCycleController
```

**File: `src/season/season_cycle_controller.py`**
```python
def __init__(self, ...):
    # ❌ ALWAYS starts in REGULAR_SEASON, never restored from database
    self.phase_state = PhaseState(SeasonPhase.REGULAR_SEASON)
```

## The Fix

Three complementary fixes were applied:

### Fix #1: Load and Cache Phase in SimulationController

**File**: `ui/controllers/simulation_controller.py:118-135`

```python
def _load_state(self):
    """Load and cache current state."""
    state_info = self.state_model.initialize_state()

    self.current_date_str = state_info['current_date']
    self.current_week = state_info['current_week']

    # NEW: Cache loaded phase for later synchronization
    self.loaded_phase = state_info.get('current_phase', 'REGULAR_SEASON')

    print(f"[DEBUG SimulationController] Loaded phase from database: {self.loaded_phase}")
```

### Fix #2: Synchronize Phase and Restore Controllers

**File**: `ui/controllers/simulation_controller.py:74-106`

```python
def _init_season_controller(self):
    """Initialize or restore SeasonCycleController using already-loaded state."""
    start_date = Date.from_string(self.current_date_str)

    self.season_controller = SeasonCycleController(...)

    # NEW: Synchronize phase_state with loaded phase
    from calendar.season_phase_tracker import SeasonPhase

    if self.loaded_phase == 'PLAYOFFS' or self.loaded_phase == 'playoffs':
        print(f"[DEBUG SimulationController] Synchronizing phase to PLAYOFFS")
        self.season_controller.phase_state.phase = SeasonPhase.PLAYOFFS
        # Restore playoff controller to reconstruct bracket
        self.season_controller._restore_playoff_controller()
    elif self.loaded_phase == 'OFFSEASON' or self.loaded_phase == 'offseason':
        print(f"[DEBUG SimulationController] Synchronizing phase to OFFSEASON")
        self.season_controller.phase_state.phase = SeasonPhase.OFFSEASON
        self.season_controller.active_controller = None
```

### Fix #3: Add _restore_playoff_controller() Method

**File**: `src/season/season_cycle_controller.py:621-696`

New method that reconstructs playoff state from database when loading mid-playoffs:

```python
def _restore_playoff_controller(self):
    """
    Restore PlayoffController when loading saved dynasty mid-playoffs.

    Reconstructs bracket from existing database events without re-scheduling games.
    """
    # 1. Query final standings from database
    # 2. Calculate playoff seeding
    # 3. Initialize PlayoffController (detects existing games)
    # 4. Share calendar for date continuity
    # 5. Set as active controller
```

### Fix #4: Guard Against Redundant Transitions

**File**: `src/season/season_cycle_controller.py:530-536`

```python
def _transition_to_playoffs(self):
    """Execute transition from regular season to playoffs."""
    # NEW: Guard against redundant transitions
    if self.phase_state.phase == SeasonPhase.PLAYOFFS:
        if self.verbose_logging:
            print(f"\n⚠️  Already in playoffs phase, skipping transition")
        return

    # ... rest of transition logic
```

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Phase Synchronization**: Loaded phase from database now properly updates SeasonCycleController's phase_state
2. **Controller Restoration**: When loading mid-playoffs, PlayoffController is restored (not left as None)
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Original fix in `playoff_controller.py` (checking game_id) detects existing games
4. **Redundancy Guard**: Prevents unnecessary re-initialization even if transition method called multiple times

### Execution Flow (After Fix)

```
1. User closes app mid-playoffs
2. User reopens app → main.py → MainWindow → SimulationController
3. SimulationController.__init__():
   → _load_state() loads phase="PLAYOFFS" and caches it ✅
4. _init_season_controller():
   → Creates SeasonCycleController (starts with REGULAR_SEASON)
   → Synchronizes phase_state to PLAYOFFS ✅
   → Calls _restore_playoff_controller() ✅
   → Reconstructs bracket from database (detects 6 existing games)
5. User simulates a day/week:
   → SeasonCycleController.advance_day() → _check_phase_transition()
   → Sees phase == PLAYOFFS (correct!) ✅
   → Skips regular season completion check
   → No redundant transition ✅
```

## Testing

### Demo Test (Passes)

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python demo/playoff_tester_demo/playoff_duplication_test.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
[6/7] Initializing PlayoffController #2 (simulating reload)...
⚠️  Skipped 6 already-scheduled playoff game(s)
     ✅ PlayoffController #2 initialized

================================================================================
✅ TEST PASSED: No duplicates detected!
   Playoff initialization is idempotent.
================================================================================
```

### UI Test Instructions

1. Start new dynasty in UI
2. Simulate to mid-playoffs (e.g., complete 3 of 6 Wild Card games)
3. Close application
4. Reopen application and load same dynasty
5. Verify in database: Only 6 Wild Card games exist (not 12)
6. Continue simulation through playoffs
7. Verify: No duplicate games at any round

### Database Verification

```bash
sqlite3 your_database.db "SELECT game_id, COUNT(*) as count FROM events WHERE game_id LIKE 'playoff_%' GROUP BY game_id HAVING count > 1;"
```

Should return **empty result** (no duplicates).
