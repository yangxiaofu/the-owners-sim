Calendar Data Model - Domain Model Pattern Reference Implementation

This module demonstrates the Domain Model pattern for The Owner's Sim UI architecture.

ARCHITECTURE PATTERN:
-------------------
The domain model serves as an intermediary layer between the UI Controller and the
database/business logic layer. It provides the following benefits:

1. SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
   - Controller: UI orchestration only (no business logic, no database access)
   - Domain Model: Business logic and database access
   - View: Display and user interaction only

2. TESTABILITY
   - Domain models can be tested independently without Qt/UI dependencies
   - Controllers become thin orchestrators that are easier to test
   - Clear contracts between layers

3. REUSABILITY
   - Business logic can be shared across multiple controllers/views
   - Database access patterns are centralized
   - No duplication of query logic

4. MAINTAINABILITY
   - Changes to business logic don't require controller changes
   - Database schema changes are isolated to domain models
   - Clear ownership of responsibilities

USAGE EXAMPLE:
-------------
    # In controller __init__:
    self.data_model = CalendarDataModel(
        db_path="data/database/nfl_simulation.db",
        dynasty_id="chiefs_dynasty",
        season=2025
    )

    # In controller methods:
    events = self.data_model.get_events_for_month(2025, 9)
    current_date = self.data_model.get_current_simulation_date()

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
--------------------
- NO Qt dependencies (can be tested without UI)
- NO UI concerns (colors, formatting, widgets)
- Returns clean data structures (dicts, lists)
- Owns all database API instances
- Contains all business logic and query patterns
- Type-hinted for clarity and IDE support

    Domain model for calendar data access and business logic.

    This class demonstrates the Domain Model pattern by:
    - Owning all database API instances (EventDatabaseAPI, DatabaseAPI, DynastyStateAPI)
    - Encapsulating all business logic for calendar operations
    - Providing clean, testable interfaces without UI dependencies
    - Serving as a reference implementation for other domain models

    Responsibilities:
    - Query events from multiple database tables (events, games)
    - Merge and deduplicate event data from different sources
    - Convert database records to standardized event format
    - Handle date range calculations and timestamp conversions
    - Manage dynasty-specific data isolation

        Get filtered events for a specific month (both scheduled and completed).

        BUSINESS LOGIC:
        --------------
        This method demonstrates complex business logic that belongs in a domain model:

        1. Query multiple data sources (events table + games table)
        2. Merge data from different sources into unified format
        3. Deduplicate records (avoid showing same game twice)
        4. Convert timestamps between different formats
        5. Apply dynasty-specific filtering
        6. Sort and return standardized data structure

        WHY THIS BELONGS IN DOMAIN MODEL:
        ---------------------------------
        - Complex database queries involving multiple tables
        - Business rules (deduplication, format conversion)
        - No UI concerns (returns plain data structures)
        - Reusable across different controllers/views
        - Testable without Qt dependencies

        IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
        ----------------------
        Queries both events table (scheduled) and games table (completed) to provide
        a complete calendar view. Events that haven't been played yet come from events,
        while completed games come from games table with results.

        Args:
            year: Year to query
            month: Month to query (1-12)
            event_types: Optional list of event types to filter by
                        (e.g., ['GAME', 'DEADLINE', 'WINDOW'])
                        If None, returns all event types

        Returns:
            List of event dictionaries matching the criteria, ordered by timestamp.
