Season Data Model for The Owner's Sim UI

Domain model that encapsulates season data access, team management, and standings retrieval.
Owns all database API instances and provides clean data access interface for controllers.

Architecture:
    View Layer → Controller Layer → Domain Model Layer (THIS) → Database APIs

Responsibilities:
    - OWN: Database API instances (TeamDataLoader, DatabaseAPI, EventDatabaseAPI, etc.)
    - DO: All season data access, team queries, standings retrieval, schedule generation
    - RETURN: Clean DTOs/dicts to controllers
    - NO: Qt dependencies, UI concerns, user interaction handling
