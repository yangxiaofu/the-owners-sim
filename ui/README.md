## Development Notes

### Integration with Simulation Engine

The UI layer (`ui/`) is completely separate from the simulation engine (`src/`):

```python
# UI Controller pattern
from src.season.season_cycle_controller import SeasonCycleController
from src.database.api import DatabaseAPI

class SeasonController:
    def __init__(self, db_path, dynasty_id):
        self.db = DatabaseAPI(db_path)
        self.season_sim = SeasonCycleController(db_path, dynasty_id)

    def simulate_day(self):
        result = self.season_sim.advance_day()
        return result  # UI formats and displays
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test UI imports
python test_ui.py

# Run application
python main.py
```

### Customizing Styles

Edit `ui/resources/styles/main.qss` to customize the appearance. The current theme is OOTP-inspired with:
- Blue accent color (#0066cc)
- Clean tab design
- Professional data tables
- Hover effects

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'PySide6'"
```bash
pip install -r requirements-ui.txt
```

### "No module named 'ui'"
Make sure you're running from the project root directory.

### Application won't launch
Check that all view files exist:
```bash
ls -la ui/views/
```
