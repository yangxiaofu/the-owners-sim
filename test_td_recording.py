The issue is a timing/sequencing problem in the game loop:

1. Play simulators create PlayStatsSummary with points_scored = 0
2. Play simulators call _add_touchdown_attribution() which checks:
   if points_scored == 6:  # This is ALWAYS FALSE because points_scored = 0
       # Add TDs to player stats
3. Play result returns to game loop
4. FieldTracker.process_play() detects ball crossed goal line
5. FieldTracker THEN sets points_scored = 6  (TOO LATE!)
6. Player stats already finalized without TDs

SOLUTION:
- Move TD attribution to AFTER FieldTracker detects scoring
- Or, have FieldTracker call back to update player stats with TDs
- Or, have DriveManager post-process results after FieldTracker
