## Testing Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Franchise Tag a Star Player
1. Advance to March 5 (franchise tag deadline)
2. Apply franchise tag to player (test with player_id=101, team_id=9)
3. Check team tag status (should show 1 tag used)
4. Try to apply another tag (should fail - 1 tag limit)

### Scenario 2: Free Agency Signing Spree
1. Advance to March 13 (free agency opens)
2. Sign multiple free agents with different contract terms
3. Monitor cap space decreasing with each signing
4. Try to sign player without enough cap space (should fail)

### Scenario 3: Complete NFL Draft
1. Advance to April 24 (draft starts)
2. Make manual selections for user team
3. Simulate remaining rounds with AI
4. View complete draft results

### Scenario 4: Roster Cuts
1. Advance to August 26 (roster cut deadline)
2. Cut players to reach 53-man roster
3. Test June 1 designation for spreading dead money
4. Finalize roster for season start

## Architecture Notes

The demo uses the full `OffseasonController` API:

```python
controller = OffseasonController(
    database_path="data/database/nfl_simulation.db",
    dynasty_id="offseason_demo",
    season_year=2024,
    user_team_id=9,
    super_bowl_date=datetime(2025, 2, 9),
    enable_persistence=True,
    verbose_logging=True
)
```

All operations go through the controller, which delegates to:
- `TagManager` - Franchise/transition tags, RFA tenders
- `CapCalculator` - Cap space validation
- `DraftManager` - Draft operations (stub)
- `FreeAgencyManager` - Free agency operations (stub)
- `RosterManager` - Roster management (stub)

## Error Handling

The demo demonstrates proper error handling:

- **Phase Validation** - "Cannot sign free agents during legal tampering period"
- **Cap Space Validation** - "Insufficient cap space. Need $15M, have $10M"
- **Tag Limits** - "Team has already used their tag this season"
- **Contract Validation** - "Invalid contract length: 10 years (must be 1-7)"

## Next Steps

After testing the demo, the next steps are:

1. **Implement Manager Logic** - Fill in stub methods in DraftManager, FreeAgencyManager, RosterManager
2. **Player Data Integration** - Connect to player/contract database tables
3. **AI Decision Logic** - Implement AI team decision making for tags, FA, draft
4. **Full Season Integration** - Connect to SeasonCycleController for complete season loop

## Troubleshooting

**Demo crashes on startup:**
- Ensure database exists: `data/database/nfl_simulation.db`
- Check PYTHONPATH is set correctly: `PYTHONPATH=src`

**Phase validation errors:**
- Operations are locked to specific phases (e.g., can't sign FAs before March 13)
- Use calendar advancement to reach correct phase

**Empty results for candidates/pool:**
- This is expected - player data not yet integrated
- Focus on testing calendar, validation, and action tracking
