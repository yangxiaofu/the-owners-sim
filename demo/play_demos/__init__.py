Play Demos

Demonstrations of individual play simulations showing:
- Pass play mechanics with real NFL player data
- Run play mechanics with formation matchups
- Player roster management and personnel packages

These demos showcase the core play engine functionality at the individual play level,
as opposed to full game or season simulations.
