# Playoff System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Divisional Scheduling Error
**Issue**: "Expected 3 wild card winners, got 0" when selecting "simulate round"

**Root Cause**: `_schedule_next_round()` was using `get_active_round()` which returns the first INCOMPLETE round, not the last COMPLETED round.

**Fix**: Modified `_schedule_next_round()` to properly detect the completed round:
- If active round is complete, use it as completed round
- If active round is incomplete, use the previous round as completed round
- Then schedule the round AFTER the completed round

**Files Changed**:
- `playoff_controller.py` lines 819-861

### 2. Game ID Parsing with Underscores in Dynasty ID
**Issue**: Games from later rounds (Divisional, Conference, etc.) were being stored in Wild Card's completed_games

**Root Cause**: `_detect_game_round()` was splitting game_id by '_' and assuming a fixed position for the round. But when dynasty_id contains underscores (e.g., "debug_dynasty"), the parsing broke.

**Example**:
- Game ID: `playoff_debug_dynasty_2024_wild_card_1`
- Split: `['playoff', 'debug', 'dynasty', '2024', 'wild', 'card', '1']`
- Old logic tried `parts[3]` = '2024' (wrong!)

**Fix**: Changed to regex-based detection that matches from the end:
- Pattern: `_{round_name}_\d+$`
- Matches: "_wild_card_1", "_divisional_2", etc.
- Works regardless of underscores in dynasty_id

**Files Changed**:
- `playoff_controller.py` lines 961-993

### 3. Round Completion Check Bug
**Issue**: `advance_to_next_round()` would loop for 30 days after Wild Card completed

**Root Cause**: Loop condition `while not self._is_active_round_complete()` called `get_active_round()` on EVERY iteration. After Wild Card completed, `get_active_round()` returned 'divisional' (incomplete), so loop continued trying to complete Divisional even though it wasn't scheduled yet.

**Fix**:
- Created `_is_round_complete(round_name)` to check a SPECIFIC round
- Changed loop to: `while not self._is_round_complete(round_to_complete)`
- Now checks the same round throughout the loop instead of re-evaluating which round is active

**Files Changed**:
- `playoff_controller.py` lines 365-376, 785-811

### 4. Advance Week String/Dict Mismatch
**Issue**: "string indices must be integers, not 'str'" error after simulating a round

**Root Cause**: UI code expected `result['all_games']` and treated `rounds_completed` items as dicts with `'round_name'` key, but they were actually strings.

**Fix**: Updated `interactive_playoff_sim.py` to:
- Treat `rounds_completed` as list of strings
- Extract games from `daily_results` instead of non-existent `all_games`

**Files Changed**:
- `interactive_playoff_sim.py` lines 221-238

### 5. Playoff Status Display
**Issue**: Status showed "Wild Card" even after Wild Card was complete and Divisional was scheduled

**Root Cause**: Status display used `current_round` which only updates when games from next round simulate, not when round completes.

**Fix**:
- Created `get_active_round()` method that calculates active round based on completion status
- Updated `get_current_state()` to include `active_round` key
- Updated UI to use `active_round` for display

**Files Changed**:
- `playoff_controller.py` lines 576-604
- `display_utils.py` lines 88-90
- `interactive_playoff_sim.py` lines 124-125

## Test Results

All tests now pass:

### Full Playoff Progression Test
```
✅ Wild Card: 6 games
✅ Divisional: 4 games
✅ Conference: 2 games
✅ Super Bowl: 1 game
✅ Total: 13 games

✅ All rounds automatically scheduled and simulated correctly!
```

### Playoff Status Fix Test
```
✅ Initial status: Wild Card
✅ After Wild Card complete: Status shows Divisional (not Wild Card)
✅ After Divisional complete: Status shows Conference
✅ After Conference complete: Status shows Super Bowl
```

### Advance Week Fix Test
```
✅ advance_week() returns correct dictionary structure
✅ rounds_completed is list of strings (not dicts)
✅ Game results can be extracted from daily_results
✅ No 'string indices must be integers' error
```

## Key Architectural Improvements

1. **Robust Game ID Parsing**: Now handles dynasty IDs with underscores
2. **Accurate Round Tracking**: Distinction between `current_round` (last simulated) and `active_round` (first incomplete)
3. **Correct Round Completion**: Checks specific rounds instead of re-evaluating active round
4. **Progressive Scheduling**: Properly schedules each round after the previous completes
