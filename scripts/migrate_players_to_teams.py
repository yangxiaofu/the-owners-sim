Player Data Migration Script
============================

Migrates the large players.json file into team-based files for better organization.
Splits players by team_id into individual JSON files in src/data/players/ directory.

Usage:
    python migrate_players_to_teams.py [--dry-run] [--test-teams team1,team2,...]

Options:
    --dry-run: Preview changes without writing files
    --test-teams: Only migrate specific teams (comma-separated team IDs)
