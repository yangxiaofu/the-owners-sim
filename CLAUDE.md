### Key Design Patterns

**Match/Case Play Selection**: The main play engine uses Python's match/case for clean play type routing:
```python
match offensive_play_type:
    case OffensivePlayType.RUN:
        # Run play logic
    case OffensivePlayType.PASS | OffensivePlayType.PLAY_ACTION_PASS | OffensivePlayType.SCREEN_PASS:
        # All pass plays handled together
    case _:
        raise ValueError(f"Unhandled play type: {offensive_play_type}")
```

**Unified Formation System**: Type-safe enum-based formations with context-aware naming:
```python
class UnifiedDefensiveFormation(Enum):
    # Single formation definition with different names for different contexts
    # coordinator_name="punt_return", punt_name="defensive_punt_return"
```

**Coaching Staff Architecture**: Hierarchical coaching system with realistic NFL roles:
```python
# CoachingStaff -> HeadCoach -> OffensiveCoordinator/DefensiveCoordinator/SpecialTeamsCoordinator
# Each coach has archetype-based decision making and situational logic
# Special teams coordinator handles punts, field goals, kickoffs independently
```

**JSON Configuration System**: All game data is externalized:
- `src/data/teams.json`: Complete NFL team dataset with numerical IDs
- `src/config/penalties/`: 5 JSON files for penalty configuration
- `src/config/coaching_staff/`: Individual coach profiles with realistic NFL coaching styles
- `src/config/playbooks/`: Team strategic approaches and play selection preferences
- `src/config/team_coaching_styles.json`: Maps all 32 NFL teams to coaching philosophies
- Supports designer-friendly configuration without code changes

**Two-Phase Penalty Integration**:
1. Phase 1: Base play outcome using formation matchup matrix
2. Phase 2A: Penalty determination and effects
3. Phase 2B: Player statistics attribution

**Database-Driven Persistence Architecture**:
- In-memory stores for fast access during simulation
- `DatabaseAPI` as single source of truth for data retrieval
- `DailyDataPersister` for batch persistence after each simulation day
- SQLite database for permanent storage with dynasty support

**Game Simulation Integration**:
- `GameSimulationEvent`: Standalone wrapper for individual NFL games
- `FullGameSimulator`: Core game simulation engine
- `StoreManager`: Game result persistence and statistics tracking
- Modular design for flexible game scheduling

## Data Management

### Team System
- Uses numerical team IDs (1-32) instead of team names
- Access via `TeamIDs.DETROIT_LIONS` constants or `get_team_by_id(22)`
- Rich metadata including colors, divisions, conferences
- Division rivals and random matchup generation

### Player System
- Players have penalty-related attributes: `discipline`, `composure`, `experience`, `penalty_technique`
- Team-aware player names (e.g., "Detroit Starting QB")
- Position-based roster generation
- **Team-Based Files**: Player data now stored in individual team files (`src/data/players/team_XX_team_name.json`)
- **Backward Compatibility**: `PlayerDataLoader` supports both team-based and legacy single-file formats
- **Migration Support**: Use `scripts/migrate_players_to_teams.py` for data migration between formats

### Configuration Files
- `src/config/penalties/penalty_rates.json`: Base penalty rates
- `src/config/penalties/discipline_effects.json`: Player discipline modifiers
- `src/config/penalties/situational_modifiers.json`: Field position/down effects
- `src/config/penalties/penalty_descriptions.json`: Contextual descriptions
- `src/config/penalties/home_field_settings.json`: Home field advantage
- `src/config/coaching_staff/`: Individual coach profiles (head_coaches/, offensive_coordinators/, defensive_coordinators/)
- `src/config/playbooks/`: Team playbook strategies (aggressive.json, balanced.json, conservative.json)
- `src/config/team_coaching_styles.json`: Team-specific coaching staff assignments (maps team IDs to coaching styles)
- `src/play_engine/config/`: Play-specific configuration files (run_play_config.json, pass_play_config.json, field_goal_config.json, kickoff_config.json, punt_config.json)
- `data/database/nfl_simulation.db`: SQLite database for persistent storage
- Dynasty context and season initialization configurations

## Testing Strategy

The project uses multiple testing approaches:

1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/`): Traditional pytest-based unit testing
2. **Interactive Testing**: Menu-driven play-by-play testing and validation scripts
3. **Validation Scripts** (`quick_test.py`, `simple_penalty_validation.py`): Automated validation
4. **Demo Scripts**: Full system demonstrations with realistic scenarios

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Database Issues
- **Empty stats/standings**: Run diagnostic scripts like `team_corruption_tracker.py` or `simple_stats_check.py`
- **Transaction failures**: Check `detailed_transaction_tracking.log` for persistence errors
- **Data inconsistency**: Use validation scripts in tests/ directory for verification

### Testing Issues
- **Test failures**: Always run with `PYTHONPATH=src` or `PYTHONPATH=.` prefix for imports
- **Module not found**: Ensure virtual environment is activated and dependencies installed
- **Performance issues**: Install and use `pytest-benchmark` if needed for performance testing

### Development Workflow
- **Before committing**: Run relevant tests and consider using black/pylint if available
- **New features**: Follow existing patterns and add corresponding tests
- **Team ID validation**: Always use numerical IDs (1-32), never team name strings

## Key Implementation Details

### NFL Realism
- Penalty rates: 20-30% per play (NFL realistic)
- Home field advantage: 10-15% penalty reduction
- Situational modifiers: Red zone +40% penalties, 4th down +25%
- Discipline impact: Low discipline teams get 1.4x more penalties

### Formation System
- Formation-based personnel selection
- Offensive/defensive formation compatibility validation
- Personnel package management for different play types
- Type-safe enum-based formations eliminate string-based bugs
- Context-aware naming (coordinator vs simulator vs display names)

### Coaching Staff Integration
- Realistic NFL coaching hierarchies (Head Coach → Coordinators)
- Coach archetypes: ultra_conservative, conservative, balanced, aggressive, ultra_aggressive
- Position-specific specialties: pass_heavy, run_heavy, balanced offensive styles
- Situational decision making: fourth down matrix, game situation analysis
- Team-specific coaching assignments for all 32 NFL teams
- Special teams coordinator: Dedicated special teams philosophy (aggressive, conservative, balanced)

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive validation for team IDs (must be 1-32)
- Graceful handling of invalid play types with descriptive errors
- Clear migration paths for breaking changes

### Persistence Control
- **Optional Statistics Persistence**: Control whether game statistics are saved to database
- **Constructor Parameter**: `enable_persistence=False` to disable persistence at creation
- **Runtime Property**: `simulator.persistence = False` to toggle persistence on/off
- **Performance Benefits**: No database I/O overhead when persistence is disabled
- **Use Cases**: Quick demos, testing, performance benchmarks, standalone simulations
- **Default Behavior**: Persistence enabled by default for backward compatibility
- **Clear Feedback**: System provides clear messages when persistence is disabled/enabled

```python
# Disable persistence at creation
simulator = FullGameSimulator(away_team_id=7, home_team_id=9, enable_persistence=False)

# Toggle persistence via property
simulator.persistence = False  # Disable database saves
simulator.persistence = True   # Re-enable database saves

# Check persistence status
if simulator.persistence:
    print("Statistics will be saved to database")
else:
    print("Statistics will not be saved (demo mode)")
```

### Database Flexibility
- **Flexible Database Configuration**: Choose which database to persist statistics to
- **Constructor Parameter**: `database_path="custom.db"` to set database at creation
- **Runtime Property**: `simulator.database_path = "new.db"` to change database path
- **Automatic Service Recreation**: Statistics service recreated when database path changes
- **Multiple Use Cases**: Dynasty management, season isolation, testing with in-memory databases
- **Default Behavior**: Uses `"data/database/nfl_simulation.db"` if not specified
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if database path change fails

```python
# Set custom database at creation
simulator = FullGameSimulator(away_team_id=7, home_team_id=9, database_path="my_dynasty.db")

# User's preferred pattern: set database, then enable persistence
simulator = FullGameSimulator(away_team_id=7, home_team_id=9, enable_persistence=False)
simulator.database_path = "season_2024.db"
simulator.persistence = True

# Runtime database switching
simulator.database_path = "playoff_games.db"  # Auto-recreates service if persistence enabled

# Testing with in-memory database
simulator = FullGameSimulator(..., database_path=":memory:")

# Dynasty management example
simulator.database_path = f"dynasty_{user_team_name}.db"
simulator.persistence = True
```

### Dynasty Context
- **Dynasty Isolation**: Complete statistical separation between different dynasties
- **Constructor Parameter**: `dynasty_id="my_dynasty"` to set dynasty context at creation
- **Runtime Property**: `simulator.dynasty_id = "new_dynasty"` to change dynasty context
- **Automatic Service Recreation**: Statistics service recreated when dynasty context changes
- **Combined Flexibility**: Works seamlessly with database path configuration
- **Default Behavior**: Uses `"default_dynasty"` if not specified
- **Multiple Dynasties**: Can run multiple dynasties in same database or separate databases

```python
# Set custom dynasty at creation
simulator = FullGameSimulator(away_team_id=7, home_team_id=9, dynasty_id="eagles_rebuild")

# User's preferred pattern: set dynasty, then enable persistence
simulator = FullGameSimulator(away_team_id=7, home_team_id=9, enable_persistence=False)
simulator.dynasty_id = "chiefs_championship_run"
simulator.persistence = True

# Combined database and dynasty flexibility
simulator.database_path = "dynasties/eagles.db"
simulator.dynasty_id = "eagles_superbowl_quest"
simulator.persistence = True

# Runtime dynasty switching
simulator.dynasty_id = "eagles_rebuild_2024"  # Auto-recreates service if persistence enabled

# Multiple dynasty management
eagles_sim = FullGameSimulator(..., dynasty_id="eagles_legacy", database_path="dynasties/eagles.db")
chiefs_sim = FullGameSimulator(..., dynasty_id="chiefs_dynasty", database_path="dynasties/chiefs.db")

# Same database, different dynasties
sim1 = FullGameSimulator(..., dynasty_id="user1_dynasty", database_path="shared.db")
sim2 = FullGameSimulator(..., dynasty_id="user2_dynasty", database_path="shared.db")
```
