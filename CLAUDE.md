### Key Design Patterns

**Match/Case Play Selection**: The main play engine uses Python's match/case for clean play type routing:
```python
match offensive_play_type:
    case OffensivePlayType.RUN:
        # Run play logic
    case OffensivePlayType.PASS | OffensivePlayType.PLAY_ACTION_PASS | OffensivePlayType.SCREEN_PASS:
        # All pass plays handled together
    case _:
        raise ValueError(f"Unhandled play type: {offensive_play_type}")
```

**Unified Formation System**: Type-safe enum-based formations with context-aware naming:
```python
class UnifiedDefensiveFormation(Enum):
    # Single formation definition with different names for different contexts
    # coordinator_name="punt_return", punt_name="defensive_punt_return"
```

**Coaching Staff Architecture**: Hierarchical coaching system with realistic NFL roles:
```python
# CoachingStaff -> HeadCoach -> OffensiveCoordinator/DefensiveCoordinator/SpecialTeamsCoordinator
# Each coach has archetype-based decision making and situational logic
# Special teams coordinator handles punts, field goals, kickoffs independently
```

**JSON Configuration System**: All game data is externalized:
- `src/data/teams.json`: Complete NFL team dataset with numerical IDs
- `src/config/penalties/`: 5 JSON files for penalty configuration
- `src/config/coaching_staff/`: Individual coach profiles with realistic NFL coaching styles
- `src/config/playbooks/`: Team strategic approaches and play selection preferences
- `src/config/team_coaching_styles.json`: Maps all 32 NFL teams to coaching philosophies
- Supports designer-friendly configuration without code changes

**Two-Phase Penalty Integration**:
1. Phase 1: Base play outcome using formation matchup matrix
2. Phase 2A: Penalty determination and effects
3. Phase 2B: Player statistics attribution

**Database-Driven Persistence Architecture**:
- In-memory stores for fast access during simulation
- `DatabaseAPI` as single source of truth for data retrieval
- `DailyDataPersister` for batch persistence after each simulation day
- SQLite database for permanent storage with dynasty support

**Game Simulation Integration**:
- `GameSimulationEvent`: Standalone wrapper for individual NFL games
- `FullGameSimulator`: Core game simulation engine
- `StoreManager`: Game result persistence and statistics tracking
- Modular design for flexible game scheduling

## Data Management

### Team System
- Uses numerical team IDs (1-32) instead of team names
- Access via `TeamIDs.DETROIT_LIONS` constants or `get_team_by_id(22)`
- Rich metadata including colors, divisions, conferences
- Division rivals and random matchup generation

### Player System  
- Players have penalty-related attributes: `discipline`, `composure`, `experience`, `penalty_technique`
- Team-aware player names (e.g., "Detroit Starting QB")
- Position-based roster generation

### Configuration Files
- `src/config/penalties/penalty_rates.json`: Base penalty rates
- `src/config/penalties/discipline_effects.json`: Player discipline modifiers
- `src/config/penalties/situational_modifiers.json`: Field position/down effects
- `src/config/penalties/penalty_descriptions.json`: Contextual descriptions
- `src/config/penalties/home_field_settings.json`: Home field advantage
- `src/config/coaching_staff/`: Individual coach profiles (head_coaches/, offensive_coordinators/, defensive_coordinators/)
- `src/config/playbooks/`: Team playbook strategies (aggressive.json, balanced.json, conservative.json)
- `src/config/team_coaching_styles.json`: Team-specific coaching staff assignments (maps team IDs to coaching styles)
- `src/play_engine/config/`: Play-specific configuration files (run_play_config.json, pass_play_config.json, field_goal_config.json, kickoff_config.json, punt_config.json)
- `data/database/nfl_simulation.db`: SQLite database for persistent storage
- Dynasty context and season initialization configurations

## Testing Strategy

The project uses multiple testing approaches:

1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/`): Traditional pytest-based unit testing
2. **Interactive Testing**: Menu-driven play-by-play testing and validation scripts
3. **Validation Scripts** (`quick_test.py`, `simple_penalty_validation.py`): Automated validation
4. **Demo Scripts**: Full system demonstrations with realistic scenarios

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in `docs/`:

- **Architecture**: `docs/architecture/play_engine.md` - Core system architecture documentation
- **System Summaries**: 
  - `docs/PENALTY_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md` - Penalty system overview
  - `docs/TEAM_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md` - Team management system details
  - `docs/TEST_GUIDE.md` - Testing guidelines and approaches
- **Planning Documents**: `docs/plans/` - Architecture plans and data flow analysis

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Database Issues
- **Empty stats/standings**: Run diagnostic scripts like `team_corruption_tracker.py` or `simple_stats_check.py`
- **Transaction failures**: Check `detailed_transaction_tracking.log` for persistence errors
- **Data inconsistency**: Use validation scripts in tests/ directory for verification

### Testing Issues
- **Test failures**: Always run with `PYTHONPATH=src` or `PYTHONPATH=.` prefix for imports
- **Module not found**: Ensure virtual environment is activated and dependencies installed
- **Performance issues**: Install and use `pytest-benchmark` if needed for performance testing

### Development Workflow
- **Before committing**: Run relevant tests and consider using black/pylint if available
- **New features**: Follow existing patterns and add corresponding tests
- **Team ID validation**: Always use numerical IDs (1-32), never team name strings

## Key Implementation Details

### NFL Realism
- Penalty rates: 20-30% per play (NFL realistic)
- Home field advantage: 10-15% penalty reduction
- Situational modifiers: Red zone +40% penalties, 4th down +25%
- Discipline impact: Low discipline teams get 1.4x more penalties

### Formation System
- Formation-based personnel selection
- Offensive/defensive formation compatibility validation
- Personnel package management for different play types
- Type-safe enum-based formations eliminate string-based bugs
- Context-aware naming (coordinator vs simulator vs display names)

### Coaching Staff Integration
- Realistic NFL coaching hierarchies (Head Coach → Coordinators)
- Coach archetypes: ultra_conservative, conservative, balanced, aggressive, ultra_aggressive
- Position-specific specialties: pass_heavy, run_heavy, balanced offensive styles
- Situational decision making: fourth down matrix, game situation analysis
- Team-specific coaching assignments for all 32 NFL teams
- Special teams coordinator: Dedicated special teams philosophy (aggressive, conservative, balanced)

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive validation for team IDs (must be 1-32)
- Graceful handling of invalid play types with descriptive errors
- Clear migration paths for breaking changes

### Interactive Season Simulation
- Season simulation available through `src/demo/` components

- **Real-time Standings**: Live tracking of division and conference standings
- **Dynasty Support**: Multi-season dynasty management with persistent data

## Migration Notes

Recent major changes to be aware of:

1. **Team Names → Numerical IDs**: `TeamRosterGenerator.generate_sample_roster()` now requires integer team_id instead of string team_name
2. **Play Type Consolidation**: PLAY_ACTION_PASS and SCREEN_PASS now handled under PASS case
3. **Match/Case Conversion**: Main play engine converted from if/elif to match/case pattern
4. **Unified PlayResult**: Single PlayResult class replaces multiple result classes, eliminates import conflicts
5. **Coaching Staff System**: New hierarchical coaching system with realistic NFL coaching philosophies
6. **Type-Safe Formations**: String-based formation names replaced with enum-based system
7. **Special Teams Coordinator**: New dedicated special teams coordinator with independent play calling for punts, field goals, and kickoffs
8. **Schedule Generator**: NFL schedule generation system for creating game schedules
9. **Database Architecture**: SQLite-based persistence with `DatabaseAPI` for retrieval and `DailyDataPersister` for persistence
10. **Game Integration**: `GameSimulationEvent` moved to `src/game_management/` as standalone wrapper
11. **Calendar System Removal**: Removed calendar manager, season progression, and event processing systems
12. **Demo Simplification**: Removed season simulation demos, kept basic interactive interface and play demos

When working with legacy code, check for hardcoded team names and convert to numerical IDs using the constants in `src/constants/team_ids.py`.
