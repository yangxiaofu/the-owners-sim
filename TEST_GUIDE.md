# Play Execution Testing Guide

## 🏈 Available Test Scripts

### 1. **quick_test.py** - Automated Validation
**Purpose**: Fast automated testing to validate all components work correctly.

**Usage**:
```bash
python quick_test.py
```

**What it tests**:
- ✅ Basic play execution functionality
- ✅ All play types (run, pass, field_goal, punt)
- ✅ Different game situations (goal line, short yardage, long distance)
- ✅ Personnel selection system

**Expected Output**: All 4 tests should pass with detailed results.

### 2. **test_play_execution.py** - Interactive Testing
**Purpose**: Interactive menu-driven testing for detailed play-by-play analysis.

**Usage**:
```bash
python test_play_execution.py
```

**Features**:
- 🎯 View current game situation
- 🏈 Execute single play with detailed results
- 🔄 Execute multiple consecutive plays
- 🎲 Test specific play types (run, pass, kick, punt)
- ⚙️ Setup custom game situations
- 📋 View team ratings and data
- 🔄 Reset to default situation

**Menu Options**:
1. **View Current Game Situation** - Shows down, distance, field position, teams, clock
2. **Execute Single Play** - Runs one play and shows detailed results
3. **Execute Multiple Plays** - Runs 5 consecutive plays
4. **Test Specific Play Type** - Force a specific play type
5. **Setup Custom Game Situation** - Customize down, distance, teams, etc.
6. **View Available Teams** - Show all teams and their ratings
7. **Reset to Default** - Reset to 1st & 10 from own 25

## 🧪 What Gets Tested

### Core Architecture Components
- **PlayExecutor**: Orchestrates play execution without doing simulation
- **PlayTypes**: Run, Pass, Kick, and Punt classes with Strategy pattern
- **PlayerSelector**: Personnel and formation decisions
- **PlayFactory**: Creates appropriate play type instances
- **GameState**: Field position, clock, and scoreboard management

### Play Execution Flow
1. **Situation Analysis**: Down, distance, field position, clock
2. **Play Type Selection**: Based on game situation
3. **Personnel Selection**: Formation and defensive calls
4. **Play Simulation**: Specific play type logic
5. **Result Enhancement**: Context and tracking information
6. **State Updates**: Field position, clock, score changes

### Enhanced PlayResult Tracking
- **Context Information**: Down, distance, field position, quarter, clock
- **Formation Data**: Offensive formation and defensive call
- **Advanced Metrics**: Big plays, goal line plays, pressure indicators
- **Human-Readable Summaries**: Natural language play descriptions
